line 38: Chapter 1
line 39: 
line 40: 
line 41: It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
line 42: of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
line 43: 
line 44: However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
line 45: first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
line 46: of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
line 47: of some one or other of their daughters.
line 48: 
line 49: “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
line 50: Netherfield Park is let at last?”
line 51: 
line 52: Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
line 53: 
line 54: “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
line 55: told me all about it.”
line 56: 
line 57: Mr. Bennet made no answer.
line 58: 
line 59: “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
line 60: 
line 61: “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
line 62: 
line 63: This was invitation enough.
line 64: 
line 65: “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
line 66: by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
line 67: down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
line 68: delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
line 69: is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
line 70: be in the house by the end of next week.”
line 71: 
line 72: “What is his name?”
line 73: 
line 74: “Bingley.”
line 75: 
line 76: “Is he married or single?”
line 77: 
line 78: “Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
line 79: five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
line 80: 
line 81: “How so? How can it affect them?”
line 82: 
line 83: “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You
line 84: must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
line 85: 
line 86: “Is that his design in settling here?”
line 87: 
line 88: “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
line 89: _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
line 90: soon as he comes.”
line 91: 
line 92: “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
line 93: them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
line 94: as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
line 95: party.”
line 96: 
line 97: “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
line 98: I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
line 99: grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
line 100: 
line 101: “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
line 102: 
line 103: “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
line 104: the neighbourhood.”
line 105: 
line 106: “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
line 107: 
line 108: “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
line 109: be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
line 110: go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
line 111: newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
line 112: visit him if you do not.”
line 113: 
line 114: “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
line 115: glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
line 116: hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
line 117: I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
line 118: 
line 119: “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
line 120: others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
line 121: good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”
line 122: 
line 123: “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
line 124: all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
line 125: quickness than her sisters.”
line 126: 
line 127: “Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
line 128: take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”
line 129: 
line 130: “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
line 131: are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
line 132: these last twenty years at least.”
line 133: 
line 134: “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
line 135: 
line 136: “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
line 137: thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
line 138: 
line 139: “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
line 140: visit them.”
line 141: 
line 142: “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
line 143: all.”
line 144: 
line 145: Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
line 146: reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
line 147: been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
line 148: was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
line 149: little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
line 150: she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
line 151: daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
line 152: 
line 153: 
line 154: 
line 155: Chapter 2
line 156: 
line 157: 
line 158: Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
line 159: had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
line 160: his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
line 161: paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
line 162: manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
line 163: suddenly addressed her with:
line 164: 
line 165: “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
line 166: 
line 167: “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother
line 168: resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
line 169: 
line 170: “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
line 171: assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
line 172: 
line 173: “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
line 174: of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
line 175: of her.”
line 176: 
line 177: “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
line 178: not depend on her serving you.”
line 179: 
line 180: Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
line 181: herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
line 182: 
line 183: “Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
line 184: compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
line 185: 
line 186: “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
line 187: them ill.”
line 188: 
line 189: “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is
line 190: your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
line 191: 
line 192: “To-morrow fortnight.”
line 193: 
line 194: “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back
line 195: till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
line 196: for she will not know him herself.”
line 197: 
line 198: “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
line 199: Mr. Bingley to _her_.”
line 200: 
line 201: “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
line 202: myself; how can you be so teasing?”
line 203: 
line 204: “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
line 205: very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
line 206: fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
line 207: Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
line 208: she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
line 209: take it on myself.”
line 210: 
line 211: The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
line 212: nonsense!”
line 213: 
line 214: “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
line 215: you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
line 216: them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
line 217: Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
line 218: great books and make extracts.”
line 219: 
line 220: Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
line 221: 
line 222: “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
line 223: Bingley.”
line 224: 
line 225: “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
line 226: 
line 227: “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
line 228: I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
line 229: on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
line 230: cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
line 231: 
line 232: The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
line 233: Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
line 234: was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
line 235: while.
line 236: 
line 237: “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
line 238: persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
line 239: neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
line 240: good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
line 241: word about it till now.”
line 242: 
line 243: “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
line 244: as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
line 245: 
line 246: “What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
line 247: shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
line 248: or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
line 249: pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
line 250: for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
line 251: the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
line 252: ball.”
line 253: 
line 254: “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
line 255: youngest, I'm the tallest.”
line 256: 
line 257: The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
line 258: return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
line 259: dinner.
line 260: 
line 261: 
line 262: 
line 263: Chapter 3
line 264: 
line 265: 
line 266: Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
line 267: daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
line 268: husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
line 269: in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
line 270: distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
line 271: last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
line 272: Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
line 273: delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
line 274: agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
line 275: with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
line 276: dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
line 277: hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
line 278: 
line 279: “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
line 280:  said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
line 281: married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
line 282: 
line 283: In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
line 284: ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
line 285: admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
line 286: heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
line 287: fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
line 288: window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
line 289: 
line 290: An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
line 291: had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
line 292: housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
line 293: was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
line 294: to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
line 295: disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
line 296: so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
line 297: he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
line 298: settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
line 299: a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
line 300: a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
line 301: was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
line 302: The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
line 303: day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
line 304: six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
line 305: the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
line 306: altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
line 307: another young man.
line 308: 
line 309: Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
line 310: countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
line 311: with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
line 312: looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
line 313: of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
line 314: the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
line 315: after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
line 316: pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
line 317: was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
line 318: admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
line 319: which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
line 320: proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
line 321: his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
line 322: forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
line 323: with his friend.
line 324: 
line 325: Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
line 326: people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
line 327: was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
line 328: one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
line 329: themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
line 330: only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
line 331: introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
line 332: walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
line 333: His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
line 334: in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
line 335: Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
line 336: his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
line 337: having slighted one of her daughters.
line 338: 
line 339: Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
line 340: down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
line 341: standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
line 342: Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
line 343: to join it.
line 344: 
line 345: “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
line 346: standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
line 347: dance.”
line 348: 
line 349: “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
line 350: particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
line 351: it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
line 352: another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
line 353: stand up with.”
line 354: 
line 355: “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
line 356: kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
line 357: my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
line 358: uncommonly pretty.”
line 359: 
line 360: “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
line 361: Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
line 362: 
line 363: “Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
line 364: of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
line 365: dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
line 366: 
line 367: “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
line 368: Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
line 369: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
line 370: humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
line 371: by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
line 372: smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
line 373: 
line 374: Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
line 375: remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
line 376: however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
line 377: playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
line 378: 
line 379: The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
line 380: Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
line 381: party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
line 382: distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
line 383: her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
line 384: pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
line 385: accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
line 386: fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
line 387: had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
line 388: spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
line 389: were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
line 390: a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
line 391: good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
line 392: such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on
line 393: the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
line 394: different story to hear.
line 395: 
line 396: “Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
line 397: delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
line 398: Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
line 399: she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
line 400: her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
line 401: twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
line 402: time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
line 403: up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
line 404: can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
line 405: down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
line 406: asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
line 407: and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
line 408: and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”
line 409: 
line 410: “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
line 411: “he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
line 412: his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”
line 413: 
line 414: “Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
line 415: handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
line 416: anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
line 417: Hurst's gown--”
line 418: 
line 419: Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
line 420: description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
line 421: of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
line 422: exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
line 423: 
line 424: “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
line 425: suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
line 426: all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
line 427: him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
line 428: great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
line 429: dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”
line 430: 
line 431: 
line 432: 
line 433: Chapter 4
line 434: 
line 435: 
line 436: When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
line 437: her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
line 438: much she admired him.
line 439: 
line 440: “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
line 441: good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
line 442: ease, with such perfect good breeding!”
line 443: 
line 444: “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
line 445: likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
line 446: 
line 447: “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
line 448: did not expect such a compliment.”
line 449: 
line 450: “Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
line 451: us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
line 452: could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
line 453: seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
line 454: in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
line 455: very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
line 456: stupider person.”
line 457: 
line 458: “Dear Lizzy!”
line 459: 
line 460: “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
line 461: You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
line 462: in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
line 463: life.”
line 464: 
line 465: “I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
line 466: what I think.”
line 467: 
line 468: “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
line 469: good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
line 470: others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
line 471: everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
line 472: good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
line 473: of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
line 474: too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”
line 475: 
line 476: “Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
line 477: converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
line 478: his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
line 479: neighbour in her.”
line 480: 
line 481: Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
line 482: the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
line 483: quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
line 484: and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
line 485: was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
line 486: ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
line 487: power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
line 488: conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
line 489: first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
line 490: pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
line 491: associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
line 492: entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
line 493: a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
line 494: impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
line 495: own had been acquired by trade.
line 496: 
line 497: Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
line 498: thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
line 499: estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
line 500: sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
line 501: good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
line 502: who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
line 503: remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
line 504: purchase.
line 505: 
line 506: His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
line 507: though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
line 508: means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
line 509: married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
line 510: his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
line 511: age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
line 512: to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
line 513: half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
line 514: rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
line 515: immediately.
line 516: 
line 517: Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
line 518: great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
line 519: easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
line 520: could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
line 521: never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
line 522: had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
line 523: In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
line 524: deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
line 525: reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
line 526: inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
line 527: was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
line 528: giving offense.
line 529: 
line 530: The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
line 531: characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
line 532: prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
line 533: to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
line 534: acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
line 535: conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
line 536: collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
line 537: none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
line 538: either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
line 539: but she smiled too much.
line 540: 
line 541: Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
line 542: her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
line 543: whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
line 544: established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
line 545: commendation to think of her as he chose.
line 546: 
line 547: 
line 548: 
line 549: Chapter 5
line 550: 
line 551: 
line 552: Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
line 553: were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
line 554: in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
line 555: honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
line 556: The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
line 557: disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
line 558: and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
line 559: about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
line 560: where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
line 561: unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
line 562: the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
line 563: supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
line 564: nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
line 565: James's had made him courteous.
line 566: 
line 567: Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
line 568: valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
line 569: of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
line 570: Elizabeth's intimate friend.
line 571: 
line 572: That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
line 573: a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
line 574: brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
line 575: 
line 576: “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
line 577: self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.”
line 578: 
line 579: “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
line 580: 
line 581: “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
line 582: sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
line 583: _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
line 584: about Mr. Robinson.”
line 585: 
line 586: “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
line 587: I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
line 588: assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
line 589: pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
line 590: answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
line 591: beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'”
line 592: 
line 593: “Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
line 594: if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
line 595: 
line 596: “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said
line 597: Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
line 598: is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.”
line 599: 
line 600: “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
line 601: ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
line 602: a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
line 603: sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”
line 604: 
line 605: “Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
line 606: “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
line 607: 
line 608: “Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
line 609: could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
line 610: being spoke to.”
line 611: 
line 612: “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,
line 613: unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
line 614: agreeable.”
line 615: 
line 616: “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
line 617: agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
line 618: was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
line 619: heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
line 620: the ball in a hack chaise.”
line 621: 
line 622: “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
line 623: wish he had danced with Eliza.”
line 624: 
line 625: “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,
line 626: if I were you.”
line 627: 
line 628: “I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”
line 629: 
line 630: “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
line 631: often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
line 632: very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
line 633: should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
line 634: to be proud.”
line 635: 
line 636: “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
line 637: _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”
line 638: 
line 639: “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
line 640: reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
line 641: ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
line 642: nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
line 643: who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
line 644: quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
line 645: things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
line 646: be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
line 647: ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
line 648: 
line 649: “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with
line 650: his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
line 651: foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”
line 652: 
line 653: “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
line 654: Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
line 655: directly.”
line 656: 
line 657: The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
line 658: would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
line 659: 
line 660: 
line 661: 
line 662: Chapter 6
line 663: 
line 664: 
line 665: The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
line 666: was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on
line 667: the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
line 668: found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
line 669: a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
line 670: the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
line 671: pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
line 672: of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
line 673: though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
line 674: all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
line 675: was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
line 676: to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
line 677: which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
line 678: way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
line 679: was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
line 680: united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
line 681: uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
line 682: of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
line 683: 
line 684: “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
line 685: on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
line 686: so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
line 687: from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
line 688: it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
line 689: the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
line 690: attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
line 691: _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
line 692: very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
line 693: encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
line 694: affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
line 695: may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
line 696: 
line 697: “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
line 698: perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
line 699: discover it too.”
line 700: 
line 701: “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.”
line 702: 
line 703: “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
line 704: it, he must find it out.”
line 705: 
line 706: “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
line 707: meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
line 708: always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
line 709: every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
line 710: therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
line 711: attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
line 712: falling in love as much as she chooses.”
line 713: 
line 714: “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
line 715: question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
line 716: to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
line 717: these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
line 718: she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
line 719: reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
line 720: dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
line 721: and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
line 722: enough to make her understand his character.”
line 723: 
line 724: “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
line 725: only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
line 726: remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
line 727: evenings may do a great deal.”
line 728: 
line 729: “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
line 730: both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
line 731: leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
line 732: 
line 733: “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
line 734: if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
line 735: chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
line 736: twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
line 737: the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
line 738: ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
line 739: least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
line 740: have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
line 741: possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
line 742: life.”
line 743: 
line 744: “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
line 745: sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
line 746: 
line 747: Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
line 748: was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
line 749: interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
line 750: allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
line 751: ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
line 752: sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
line 753: had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
line 754: uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
line 755: this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
line 756: detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
line 757: in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
line 758: pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
line 759: of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
line 760: this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
line 761: himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
line 762: to dance with.
line 763: 
line 764: He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
line 765: with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
line 766: drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
line 767: assembled.
line 768: 
line 769: “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
line 770: conversation with Colonel Forster?”
line 771: 
line 772: “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
line 773: 
line 774: “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
line 775: what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
line 776: being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
line 777: 
line 778: On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
line 779: any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
line 780: a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
line 781: turned to him and said:
line 782: 
line 783: “Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
line 784: well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
line 785: Meryton?”
line 786: 
line 787: “With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
line 788: energetic.”
line 789: 
line 790: “You are severe on us.”
line 791: 
line 792: “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
line 793: to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
line 794: 
line 795: “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
line 796: to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
line 797: a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
line 798: really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
line 799: hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
line 800: she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
line 801: at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
line 802: course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I
line 803: shall keep mine to swell my song.”
line 804: 
line 805: Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
line 806: or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
line 807: she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
line 808: sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
line 809: the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
line 810: impatient for display.
line 811: 
line 812: Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
line 813: application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
line 814: manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
line 815: had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
line 816: much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
line 817: end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
line 818: Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
line 819: with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
line 820: dancing at one end of the room.
line 821: 
line 822: Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
line 823: passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
line 824: much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
line 825: his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
line 826: 
line 827: “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
line 828: is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
line 829: refinements of polished society.”
line 830: 
line 831: “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
line 832: the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”
line 833: 
line 834: Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
line 835: continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
line 836: not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
line 837: 
line 838: “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
line 839: 
line 840: “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
line 841: you often dance at St. James's?”
line 842: 
line 843: “Never, sir.”
line 844: 
line 845: “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
line 846: 
line 847: “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
line 848: 
line 849: “You have a house in town, I conclude?”
line 850: 
line 851: Mr. Darcy bowed.
line 852: 
line 853: “I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
line 854: of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
line 855: London would agree with Lady Lucas.”
line 856: 
line 857: He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
line 858: to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
line 859: struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
line 860: her:
line 861: 
line 862: “My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
line 863: me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
line 864: cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”
line 865:  And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
line 866: extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
line 867: drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:
line 868: 
line 869: “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
line 870: not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
line 871: 
line 872: Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
line 873: her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
line 874: all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
line 875: 
line 876: “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
line 877: me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
line 878: amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
line 879: for one half-hour.”
line 880: 
line 881: “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
line 882: 
line 883: “He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
line 884: we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
line 885: partner?”
line 886: 
line 887: Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
line 888: injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
line 889: complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
line 890: 
line 891: “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
line 892: 
line 893: “I should imagine not.”
line 894: 
line 895: “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
line 896: in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
line 897: I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
line 898: nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
line 899: I give to hear your strictures on them!”
line 900: 
line 901: “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
line 902: agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
line 903: which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
line 904: 
line 905: Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
line 906: would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
line 907: Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:
line 908: 
line 909: “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
line 910: 
line 911: “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
line 912: How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
line 913: joy?”
line 914: 
line 915: “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
line 916: imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
line 917: to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
line 918: 
line 919: “Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
line 920: absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
line 921: and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”
line 922: 
line 923: He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
line 924: entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
line 925: that all was safe, her wit flowed long.
line 926: 
line 927: 
line 928: 
line 929: Chapter 7
line 930: 
line 931: 
line 932: Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
line 933: thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
line 934: in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
line 935: fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
line 936: the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
line 937: had left her four thousand pounds.
line 938: 
line 939: She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
line 940: their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
line 941: London in a respectable line of trade.
line 942: 
line 943: The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
line 944: convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
line 945: thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
line 946: to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
line 947: Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
line 948: their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
line 949: better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
line 950: hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
line 951: the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
line 952: from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
line 953: news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
line 954: neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
line 955: headquarters.
line 956: 
line 957: Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
line 958: interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
line 959: of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
line 960: secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
line 961: Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
line 962: felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
line 963: Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
line 964: to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
line 965: regimentals of an ensign.
line 966: 
line 967: After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
line 968: Bennet coolly observed:
line 969: 
line 970: “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
line 971: of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
line 972: I am now convinced.”
line 973: 
line 974: Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
line 975: indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
line 976: and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
line 977: next morning to London.
line 978: 
line 979: “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
line 980: ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
line 981: of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.”
line 982: 
line 983: “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
line 984: 
line 985: “Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
line 986: 
line 987: “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
line 988: had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
line 989: so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
line 990: foolish.”
line 991: 
line 992: “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
line 993: their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
line 994: not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
line 995: I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
line 996: heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
line 997: should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
line 998: Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in
line 999: his regimentals.”
line 1000: 
line 1001: “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
line 1002: Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
line 1003: came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.”
line 1004: 
line 1005: Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
line 1006: a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
line 1007: for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
line 1008: eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
line 1009: 
line 1010: “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
line 1011: Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
line 1012: 
line 1013: “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
line 1014: 
line 1015: “MY DEAR FRIEND,--
line 1016: 
line 1017: “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
line 1018: we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
line 1019: for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
line 1020: quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
line 1021: gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,
line 1022: 
line 1023: “CAROLINE BINGLEY”
line 1024: 
line 1025: “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
line 1026: _that_.”
line 1027: 
line 1028: “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”
line 1029: 
line 1030: “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
line 1031: 
line 1032: “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
line 1033: rain; and then you must stay all night.”
line 1034: 
line 1035: “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
line 1036: they would not offer to send her home.”
line 1037: 
line 1038: “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,
line 1039: and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
line 1040: 
line 1041: “I had much rather go in the coach.”
line 1042: 
line 1043: “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
line 1044: wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”
line 1045: 
line 1046: “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
line 1047: 
line 1048: “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother's purpose
line 1049: will be answered.”
line 1050: 
line 1051: She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
line 1052: were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
line 1053: mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
line 1054: bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
line 1055: it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
line 1056: delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
line 1057: Jane certainly could not come back.
line 1058: 
line 1059: “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than
line 1060: once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
line 1061: next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
line 1062: contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
line 1063: brought the following note for Elizabeth:
line 1064: 
line 1065: “MY DEAREST LIZZY,--
line 1066: 
line 1067: “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
line 1068: imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
line 1069: hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
line 1070: Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
line 1071: to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
line 1072: matter with me.--Yours, etc.”
line 1073: 
line 1074: “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
line 1075: aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
line 1076: should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
line 1077: Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
line 1078: 
line 1079: “Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
line 1080: colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
line 1081: all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”
line 1082: 
line 1083: Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
line 1084: the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
line 1085: was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
line 1086: 
line 1087: “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
line 1088: thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
line 1089: there.”
line 1090: 
line 1091: “I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”
line 1092: 
line 1093: “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
line 1094: horses?”
line 1095: 
line 1096: “No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
line 1097: when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
line 1098: 
line 1099: “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
line 1100: impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
line 1101: exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
line 1102: 
line 1103: “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
line 1104: Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
line 1105: together.
line 1106: 
line 1107: “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
line 1108: see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”
line 1109: 
line 1110: In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
line 1111: of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
line 1112: field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
line 1113: over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
line 1114: within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
line 1115: glowing with the warmth of exercise.
line 1116: 
line 1117: She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
line 1118: assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
line 1119: That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
line 1120: dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
line 1121: Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
line 1122: for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
line 1123: brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there
line 1124: was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
line 1125: Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
line 1126: brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
line 1127: to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
line 1128: thinking only of his breakfast.
line 1129: 
line 1130: Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
line 1131: Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
line 1132: well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
line 1133: immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
line 1134: alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
line 1135: for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
line 1136: however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
line 1137: together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
line 1138: extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
line 1139: her.
line 1140: 
line 1141: When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
line 1142: began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
line 1143: solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
line 1144: examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
line 1145: a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
line 1146: advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
line 1147: was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
line 1148: ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
line 1149: the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
line 1150: fact, nothing to do elsewhere.
line 1151: 
line 1152: When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
line 1153: unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
line 1154: wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
line 1155: in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
line 1156: of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
line 1157: Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
line 1158: Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
line 1159: of clothes.
line 1160: 
line 1161: 
line 1162: 
line 1163: Chapter 8
line 1164: 
line 1165: 
line 1166: At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
line 1167: Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
line 1168: poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
line 1169: much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
line 1170: favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
line 1171: this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
line 1172: shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
line 1173: being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
line 1174: indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
line 1175: Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
line 1176: 
line 1177: Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
line 1178: regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
line 1179: attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
line 1180: herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
line 1181: others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
line 1182: engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
line 1183: Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
line 1184: eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
line 1185: dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
line 1186: 
line 1187: When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
line 1188: began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
line 1189: pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
line 1190: she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
line 1191: same, and added:
line 1192: 
line 1193: “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
line 1194: walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
line 1195: looked almost wild.”
line 1196: 
line 1197: “She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
line 1198: nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
line 1199: country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
line 1200: 
line 1201: “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
line 1202: in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
line 1203: hide it not doing its office.”
line 1204: 
line 1205: “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
line 1206: all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
line 1207: well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
line 1208: escaped my notice.”
line 1209: 
line 1210: “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
line 1211: inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
line 1212: an exhibition.”
line 1213: 
line 1214: “Certainly not.”
line 1215: 
line 1216: “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
line 1217: above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
line 1218: it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
line 1219: a most country-town indifference to decorum.”
line 1220: 
line 1221: “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
line 1222: Bingley.
line 1223: 
line 1224: “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that
line 1225: this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”
line 1226: 
line 1227: “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
line 1228: short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
line 1229: 
line 1230: “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
line 1231: sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
line 1232: such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
line 1233: no chance of it.”
line 1234: 
line 1235: “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
line 1236: Meryton.”
line 1237: 
line 1238: “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
line 1239: 
line 1240: “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
line 1241: 
line 1242: “If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
line 1243: would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
line 1244: 
line 1245: “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
line 1246: consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
line 1247: 
line 1248: To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
line 1249: hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
line 1250: their dear friend's vulgar relations.
line 1251: 
line 1252: With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
line 1253: leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
line 1254: She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
line 1255: late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
line 1256: when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
line 1257: downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
line 1258: party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
line 1259: them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
line 1260: excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
line 1261: below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
line 1262: 
line 1263: “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
line 1264: 
line 1265: “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
line 1266: reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
line 1267: 
line 1268: “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am
line 1269: _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
line 1270: 
line 1271: “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
line 1272: I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”
line 1273: 
line 1274: Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
line 1275: table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
line 1276: others--all that his library afforded.
line 1277: 
line 1278: “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
line 1279: credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
line 1280: than I ever looked into.”
line 1281: 
line 1282: Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
line 1283: in the room.
line 1284: 
line 1285: “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
line 1286: so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
line 1287: Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”
line 1288: 
line 1289: “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
line 1290: generations.”
line 1291: 
line 1292: “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
line 1293: books.”
line 1294: 
line 1295: “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
line 1296: these.”
line 1297: 
line 1298: “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
line 1299: that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
line 1300: half as delightful as Pemberley.”
line 1301: 
line 1302: “I wish it may.”
line 1303: 
line 1304: “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
line 1305: neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
line 1306: finer county in England than Derbyshire.”
line 1307: 
line 1308: “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”
line 1309: 
line 1310: “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
line 1311: 
line 1312: “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
line 1313: Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
line 1314: 
line 1315: Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
line 1316: little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
line 1317: near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
line 1318: eldest sister, to observe the game.
line 1319: 
line 1320: “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
line 1321: she be as tall as I am?”
line 1322: 
line 1323: “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
line 1324: rather taller.”
line 1325: 
line 1326: “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
line 1327: so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
line 1328: for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
line 1329: 
line 1330: “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
line 1331: to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
line 1332: 
line 1333: “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”
line 1334: 
line 1335: “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
line 1336: net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
line 1337: I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
line 1338: informed that she was very accomplished.”
line 1339: 
line 1340: “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
line 1341: too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
line 1342: otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
line 1343: far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
line 1344: cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
line 1345: acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”
line 1346: 
line 1347: “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
line 1348: 
line 1349: “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
line 1350: idea of an accomplished woman.”
line 1351: 
line 1352: “Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
line 1353: 
line 1354: “Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
line 1355: esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
line 1356: with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
line 1357: dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
line 1358: all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
line 1359: walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
line 1360: will be but half-deserved.”
line 1361: 
line 1362: “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must
line 1363: yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
line 1364: extensive reading.”
line 1365: 
line 1366: “I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
line 1367: I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”
line 1368: 
line 1369: “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
line 1370: this?”
line 1371: 
line 1372: “I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
line 1373: application, and elegance, as you describe united.”
line 1374: 
line 1375: Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
line 1376: implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
line 1377: answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
line 1378: bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
line 1379: conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
line 1380: room.
line 1381: 
line 1382: “Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
line 1383: “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
line 1384: other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
line 1385: succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”
line 1386: 
line 1387: “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
line 1388: “there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
line 1389: to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
line 1390: despicable.”
line 1391: 
line 1392: Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
line 1393: continue the subject.
line 1394: 
line 1395: Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
line 1396: that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
line 1397: immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
line 1398: be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
line 1399: eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
line 1400: unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
line 1401: that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
line 1402: were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
line 1403: declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
line 1404: however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
line 1405: to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
line 1406: attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
line 1407: 
line 1408: 
line 1409: 
line 1410: Chapter 9
line 1411: 
line 1412: 
line 1413: Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
line 1414: morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
line 1415: inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
line 1416: and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
line 1417: sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
line 1418: note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
line 1419: own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
line 1420: its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
line 1421: two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
line 1422: 
line 1423: Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
line 1424: very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
line 1425: not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
line 1426: restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
line 1427: would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried
line 1428: home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
line 1429: it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
line 1430: Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
line 1431: attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
line 1432: that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
line 1433: 
line 1434: “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
line 1435: moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
line 1436: a little longer on your kindness.”
line 1437: 
line 1438: “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
line 1439: sure, will not hear of her removal.”
line 1440: 
line 1441: “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
line 1442: “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
line 1443: remains with us.”
line 1444: 
line 1445: Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
line 1446: 
line 1447: “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not
line 1448: know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
line 1449: a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
line 1450: always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
line 1451: temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
line 1452: nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
line 1453: charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
line 1454: country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
line 1455: in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”
line 1456: 
line 1457: “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
line 1458: should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
line 1459: minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”
line 1460: 
line 1461: “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.
line 1462: 
line 1463: “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
line 1464: 
line 1465: “Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”
line 1466: 
line 1467: “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
line 1468: through I am afraid is pitiful.”
line 1469: 
line 1470: “That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
line 1471: character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”
line 1472: 
line 1473: “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
line 1474: the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
line 1475: 
line 1476: “I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a
line 1477: studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”
line 1478: 
line 1479: “Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
line 1480: least that advantage.”
line 1481: 
line 1482: “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for
line 1483: such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
line 1484: unvarying society.”
line 1485: 
line 1486: “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
line 1487: observed in them for ever.”
line 1488: 
line 1489: “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
line 1490: a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
line 1491: going on in the country as in town.”
line 1492: 
line 1493: Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
line 1494: turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
line 1495: victory over him, continued her triumph.
line 1496: 
line 1497: “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
line 1498: my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
line 1499: pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”
line 1500: 
line 1501: “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;
line 1502: and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
line 1503: advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”
line 1504: 
line 1505: “Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
line 1506: gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
line 1507: at all.”
line 1508: 
line 1509: “Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
line 1510: mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
line 1511: such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
line 1512: which you must acknowledge to be true.”
line 1513: 
line 1514: “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
line 1515: with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
line 1516: neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
line 1517: 
line 1518: Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
line 1519: countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
line 1520: Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
line 1521: saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
line 1522: Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.
line 1523: 
line 1524: “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
line 1525: William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
line 1526: genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
line 1527: is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
line 1528: important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”
line 1529: 
line 1530: “Did Charlotte dine with you?”
line 1531: 
line 1532: “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
line 1533: my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
line 1534: _my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
line 1535: judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
line 1536: I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
line 1537: Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”
line 1538: 
line 1539: “She seems a very pleasant young woman.”
line 1540: 
line 1541: “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
line 1542: has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast
line 1543: of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
line 1544: better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
line 1545: partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
line 1546: Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
line 1547: sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
line 1548: did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
line 1549: on her, and very pretty they were.”
line 1550: 
line 1551: “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has
line 1552: been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
line 1553: discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
line 1554: 
line 1555: “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.
line 1556: 
line 1557: “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
line 1558: strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
line 1559: am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
line 1560: 
line 1561: Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
line 1562: tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
line 1563: speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
line 1564: Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
line 1565: Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
line 1566: unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
line 1567: civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
line 1568: indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
line 1569: soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
line 1570: her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
line 1571: each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
line 1572: youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
line 1573: into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
line 1574: 
line 1575: Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
line 1576: and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
line 1577: affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
line 1578: animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
line 1579: attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own
line 1580: easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
line 1581: equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
line 1582: abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
line 1583: shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
line 1584: sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:
line 1585: 
line 1586: “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
line 1587: your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
line 1588: the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”
line 1589: 
line 1590: Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to
line 1591: wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
line 1592: would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she
line 1593: added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
line 1594: Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”
line 1595: 
line 1596: Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
line 1597: instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
line 1598: remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
line 1599: could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
line 1600: all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.
line 1601: 
line 1602: 
line 1603: 
line 1604: Chapter 10
line 1605: 
line 1606: 
line 1607: The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
line 1608: Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
line 1609: continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
line 1610: their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
line 1611: Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
line 1612: the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
line 1613: messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
line 1614: Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
line 1615: 
line 1616: Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
line 1617: attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
line 1618: commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
line 1619: of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
line 1620: with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
line 1621: exactly in union with her opinion of each.
line 1622: 
line 1623: “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”
line 1624: 
line 1625: He made no answer.
line 1626: 
line 1627: “You write uncommonly fast.”
line 1628: 
line 1629: “You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”
line 1630: 
line 1631: “How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
line 1632: year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”
line 1633: 
line 1634: “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”
line 1635: 
line 1636: “Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”
line 1637: 
line 1638: “I have already told her so once, by your desire.”
line 1639: 
line 1640: “I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
line 1641: pens remarkably well.”
line 1642: 
line 1643: “Thank you--but I always mend my own.”
line 1644: 
line 1645: “How can you contrive to write so even?”
line 1646: 
line 1647: He was silent.
line 1648: 
line 1649: “Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
line 1650: and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
line 1651: little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
line 1652: Grantley's.”
line 1653: 
line 1654: “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
line 1655: present I have not room to do them justice.”
line 1656: 
line 1657: “Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
line 1658: always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”
line 1659: 
line 1660: “They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
line 1661: to determine.”
line 1662: 
line 1663: “It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
line 1664: ease, cannot write ill.”
line 1665: 
line 1666: “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
line 1667: brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
line 1668: words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”
line 1669: 
line 1670: “My style of writing is very different from yours.”
line 1671: 
line 1672: “Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
line 1673: imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
line 1674: 
line 1675: “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
line 1676: means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”
line 1677: 
line 1678: “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
line 1679: 
line 1680: “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
line 1681: humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
line 1682: indirect boast.”
line 1683: 
line 1684: “And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”
line 1685: 
line 1686: “The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
line 1687: writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
line 1688: thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
line 1689: think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
line 1690: quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
line 1691: attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
line 1692: Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
line 1693: you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
line 1694: panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
line 1695: laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
line 1696: undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
line 1697: 
line 1698: “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
line 1699: foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
line 1700: I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
line 1701: moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
line 1702: precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
line 1703: 
line 1704: “I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
line 1705: you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
line 1706: dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
line 1707: mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better
line 1708: stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
line 1709: go--and at another word, might stay a month.”
line 1710: 
line 1711: “You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
line 1712: not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
line 1713: more than he did himself.”
line 1714: 
line 1715: “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
line 1716: friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
line 1717: afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
line 1718: intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
line 1719: circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
line 1720: could.”
line 1721: 
line 1722: “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
line 1723: as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
line 1724: 
line 1725: “Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
line 1726: himself.”
line 1727: 
line 1728: “You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
line 1729: but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
line 1730: stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
line 1731: that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
line 1732: the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
line 1733: one argument in favour of its propriety.”
line 1734: 
line 1735: “To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
line 1736: with you.”
line 1737: 
line 1738: “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
line 1739: either.”
line 1740: 
line 1741: “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
line 1742: friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
line 1743: one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
line 1744: one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
line 1745: supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
line 1746: circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
line 1747: thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
line 1748: where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
line 1749: very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
line 1750: with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
line 1751: 
line 1752: “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
line 1753: arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
line 1754: appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
line 1755: between the parties?”
line 1756: 
line 1757: “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
line 1758: forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
line 1759: weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
line 1760: you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
line 1761: myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
line 1762: know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
line 1763: particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
line 1764: when he has nothing to do.”
line 1765: 
line 1766: Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
line 1767: rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
line 1768: resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
line 1769: brother for talking such nonsense.
line 1770: 
line 1771: “I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,
line 1772: and want to silence this.”
line 1773: 
line 1774: “Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
line 1775: Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
line 1776: thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
line 1777: 
line 1778: “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
line 1779: Darcy had much better finish his letter.”
line 1780: 
line 1781: Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
line 1782: 
line 1783: When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
line 1784: for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
line 1785: to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
line 1786: the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
line 1787: seated herself.
line 1788: 
line 1789: Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
line 1790: Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
line 1791: that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
line 1792: on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
line 1793: admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
line 1794: because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
line 1795: however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
line 1796: more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
line 1797: any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
line 1798: him too little to care for his approbation.
line 1799: 
line 1800: After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
line 1801: a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
line 1802: Elizabeth, said to her:
line 1803: 
line 1804: “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
line 1805: opportunity of dancing a reel?”
line 1806: 
line 1807: She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
line 1808: surprise at her silence.
line 1809: 
line 1810: “Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately
line 1811: determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
line 1812: that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
line 1813: delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
line 1814: their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
line 1815: you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
line 1816: you dare.”
line 1817: 
line 1818: “Indeed I do not dare.”
line 1819: 
line 1820: Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
line 1821: gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
line 1822: manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
line 1823: had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
line 1824: believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
line 1825: should be in some danger.
line 1826: 
line 1827: Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
line 1828: anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
line 1829: assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
line 1830: 
line 1831: She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
line 1832: their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
line 1833: 
line 1834: “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
line 1835: the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
line 1836: desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
line 1837: and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
line 1838: officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
line 1839: check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
line 1840: which your lady possesses.”
line 1841: 
line 1842: “Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
line 1843: 
line 1844: “Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
line 1845: in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
line 1846: judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
line 1847: lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for
line 1848: what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
line 1849: 
line 1850: “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
line 1851: colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
line 1852: copied.”
line 1853: 
line 1854: At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
line 1855: Elizabeth herself.
line 1856: 
line 1857: “I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
line 1858: confusion, lest they had been overheard.
line 1859: 
line 1860: “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
line 1861: telling us that you were coming out.”
line 1862: 
line 1863: Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
line 1864: by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
line 1865: and immediately said:
line 1866: 
line 1867: “This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
line 1868: avenue.”
line 1869: 
line 1870: But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
line 1871: laughingly answered:
line 1872: 
line 1873: “No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
line 1874: to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
line 1875: fourth. Good-bye.”
line 1876: 
line 1877: She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
line 1878: being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
line 1879: as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
line 1880: 
line 1881: 
line 1882: 
line 1883: Chapter 11
line 1884: 
line 1885: 
line 1886: When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
line 1887: sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
line 1888: drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
line 1889: professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
line 1890: as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
line 1891: Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
line 1892: entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
line 1893: at their acquaintance with spirit.
line 1894: 
line 1895: But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
line 1896: Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
line 1897: something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
line 1898: himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
line 1899: made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
line 1900: and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and
line 1901: attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
line 1902: should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
line 1903: to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
line 1904: the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
line 1905: else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
line 1906: delight.
line 1907: 
line 1908: When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
line 1909: card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
line 1910: Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
line 1911: petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
line 1912: the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
line 1913: Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
line 1914: sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
line 1915: and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
line 1916: and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
line 1917: Bennet.
line 1918: 
line 1919: Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
line 1920: Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
line 1921: was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
line 1922: could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
line 1923: question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
line 1924: amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
line 1925: second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant
line 1926: it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
line 1927: enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
line 1928: book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
line 1929: an excellent library.”
line 1930: 
line 1931: No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
line 1932: cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
line 1933: her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
line 1934: towards him and said:
line 1935: 
line 1936: “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
line 1937: Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
line 1938: the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
line 1939: not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
line 1940: pleasure.”
line 1941: 
line 1942: “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
line 1943: chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
line 1944: thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
line 1945: round my cards.”
line 1946: 
line 1947: “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
line 1948: carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
line 1949: tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
line 1950: more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
line 1951: the day.”
line 1952: 
line 1953: “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
line 1954: near so much like a ball.”
line 1955: 
line 1956: Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
line 1957: about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
line 1958: Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
line 1959: the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
line 1960: turning to Elizabeth, said:
line 1961: 
line 1962: “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
line 1963: turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
line 1964: long in one attitude.”
line 1965: 
line 1966: Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
line 1967: succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
line 1968: up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
line 1969: Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
line 1970: directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
line 1971: he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
line 1972: the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
line 1973: interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
line 1974: meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
line 1975: 
line 1976: “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe
line 1977: on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
line 1978: about it.”
line 1979: 
line 1980: Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
line 1981: anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
line 1982: two motives.
line 1983: 
line 1984: “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
line 1985: as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing
line 1986: the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret
line 1987: affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
line 1988: appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
line 1989: completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
line 1990: as I sit by the fire.”
line 1991: 
line 1992: “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so
line 1993: abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”
line 1994: 
line 1995: “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We
line 1996: can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
line 1997: as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
line 1998: 
line 1999: “But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
line 2000: not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
line 2001: mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
line 2002: not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
line 2003: subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”
line 2004: 
line 2005: “Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
line 2006: uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
line 2007: be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
line 2008: laugh.”
line 2009: 
line 2010: “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.
line 2011: The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
line 2012: actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
line 2013: life is a joke.”
line 2014: 
line 2015: “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I
line 2016: am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
line 2017: Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
line 2018: and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
line 2019: what you are without.”
line 2020: 
line 2021: “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
line 2022: of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
line 2023: understanding to ridicule.”
line 2024: 
line 2025: “Such as vanity and pride.”
line 2026: 
line 2027: “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
line 2028: superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
line 2029: 
line 2030: Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
line 2031: 
line 2032: “Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
line 2033: “and pray what is the result?”
line 2034: 
line 2035: “I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
line 2036: himself without disguise.”
line 2037: 
line 2038: “No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
line 2039: but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
line 2040: for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
line 2041: convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
line 2042: so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
line 2043: are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
line 2044: would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
line 2045: forever.”
line 2046: 
line 2047: “_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment
line 2048: _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
line 2049: really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”
line 2050: 
line 2051: “There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
line 2052: evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
line 2053: 
line 2054: “And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”
line 2055: 
line 2056: “And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand
line 2057: them.”
line 2058: 
line 2059: “Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
line 2060: conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
line 2061: waking Mr. Hurst?”
line 2062: 
line 2063: Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
line 2064: opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for
line 2065: it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
line 2066: 
line 2067: 
line 2068: 
line 2069: Chapter 12
line 2070: 
line 2071: 
line 2072: In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
line 2073: next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
line 2074: them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
line 2075: her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
line 2076: would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
line 2077: them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
line 2078: least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
line 2079: Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
line 2080: before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
line 2081: and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
line 2082: very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
line 2083: resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
line 2084: contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
line 2085: she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
line 2086: length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
line 2087: that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
line 2088: 
line 2089: The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
line 2090: said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
line 2091: on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
line 2092: then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
line 2093: of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
line 2094: 
line 2095: The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
line 2096: soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
line 2097: safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
line 2098: she felt herself to be right.
line 2099: 
line 2100: To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
line 2101: Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
line 2102: Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
line 2103: He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
line 2104: should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
line 2105: of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
line 2106: suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
line 2107: in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
line 2108: ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
line 2109: at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
line 2110: conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
line 2111: 
line 2112: On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
line 2113: all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
line 2114: very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
line 2115: after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
line 2116: to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
line 2117: tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
line 2118: the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.
line 2119: 
line 2120: They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
line 2121: wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
line 2122: trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
line 2123: father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
line 2124: glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
line 2125: evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
line 2126: its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
line 2127: Elizabeth.
line 2128: 
line 2129: They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
line 2130: nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
line 2131: threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
line 2132: for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
line 2133: in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
line 2134: had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
line 2135: had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.

line 2139: Chapter 13
line 2140: 
line 2141: 
line 2142: “I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
line 2143: breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
line 2144: because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
line 2145: 
line 2146: “Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
line 2147: unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
line 2148: are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”
line 2149: 
line 2150: “The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”
line 2151: 
line 2152: Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
line 2153: Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
line 2154: Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
line 2155: got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
line 2156: moment.”
line 2157: 
line 2158: “It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
line 2159: never saw in the whole course of my life.”
line 2160: 
line 2161: This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
line 2162: eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
line 2163: 
line 2164: After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
line 2165: 
line 2166: “About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
line 2167: I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
line 2168: early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
line 2169: may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”
line 2170: 
line 2171: “Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
line 2172: Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
line 2173: in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
line 2174: children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
line 2175: to do something or other about it.”
line 2176: 
line 2177: Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
line 2178: had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
line 2179: Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
line 2180: bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
line 2181: five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
line 2182: 
line 2183: “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and
line 2184: nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
line 2185: But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
line 2186: softened by his manner of expressing himself.”
line 2187: 
line 2188: “No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
line 2189: him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
line 2190: friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
line 2191: before him?”
line 2192: 
line 2193: “Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
line 2194: head, as you will hear.”
line 2195: 
line 2196: “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.
line 2197: 
line 2198: “Dear Sir,--
line 2199: 
line 2200: “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
line 2201: father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
line 2202: misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
line 2203: for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
line 2204: seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
line 2205: with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.
line 2206: Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
line 2207: received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
line 2208: distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
line 2209: Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
line 2210: preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
line 2211: my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
line 2212: ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
line 2213: are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
line 2214: feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
line 2215: all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
line 2216: flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
line 2217: that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
line 2218: will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
line 2219: offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
line 2220: means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
line 2221: it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
line 2222: amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
line 2223: receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
line 2224: on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
line 2225: shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight
line 2226: following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
line 2227: is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
line 2228: that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
line 2229: remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
line 2230: daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
line 2231: 
line 2232: “WILLIAM COLLINS”
line 2233: 
line 2234: “At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
line 2235:  said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
line 2236: conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
line 2237: prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
line 2238: indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
line 2239: 
line 2240: “There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
line 2241: he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
line 2242: discourage him.”
line 2243: 
line 2244: “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
line 2245: to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
line 2246: credit.”
line 2247: 
line 2248: Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
line 2249: Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
line 2250: his parishioners whenever it were required.
line 2251: 
line 2252: “He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him
line 2253: out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
line 2254: mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
line 2255: would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?”
line 2256: 
line 2257: “No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
line 2258: reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
line 2259: letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”
line 2260: 
line 2261: “In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem
line 2262: defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
line 2263: think it is well expressed.”
line 2264: 
line 2265: To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
line 2266: degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
line 2267: come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
line 2268: received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
line 2269: their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
line 2270: and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
line 2271: astonished her husband and daughters.
line 2272: 
line 2273: Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
line 2274: politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
line 2275: ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
line 2276: need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
line 2277: tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
line 2278: stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
line 2279: before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
line 2280: daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
line 2281: instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
line 2282: not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
line 2283: gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
line 2284: Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.
line 2285: 
line 2286: “You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
line 2287: prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
line 2288: oddly.”
line 2289: 
line 2290: “You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
line 2291: 
line 2292: “Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
line 2293: must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
line 2294: I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
line 2295: will go when once they come to be entailed.”
line 2296: 
line 2297: “I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
line 2298: could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
line 2299: forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
line 2300: prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
line 2301: when we are better acquainted--”
line 2302: 
line 2303: He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
line 2304: other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
line 2305: hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
line 2306: and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
line 2307: heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
line 2308: own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
line 2309: he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
line 2310: cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
line 2311: assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
line 2312: good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
line 2313: begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
line 2314: herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
line 2315: quarter of an hour.
line 2316: 
line 2317: 
line 2318: 
line 2319: Chapter 14
line 2320: 
line 2321: 
line 2322: During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
line 2323: were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
line 2324: guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
line 2325: shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
line 2326: Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for
line 2327: his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
line 2328: better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
line 2329: to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
line 2330: he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
line 2331: a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
line 2332: experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
line 2333: approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
line 2334: preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
line 2335: and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
line 2336: quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
line 2337: people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
line 2338: She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
line 2339: made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
line 2340: neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
line 2341: two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
line 2342: marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
line 2343: once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
line 2344: approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
line 2345: to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.”
line 2346: 
line 2347: “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and
line 2348: I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
line 2349: in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”
line 2350: 
line 2351: “The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
line 2352: from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.”
line 2353: 
line 2354: “I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”
line 2355: 
line 2356: “She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
line 2357: extensive property.”
line 2358: 
line 2359: “Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
line 2360: many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”
line 2361: 
line 2362: “She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
line 2363: that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
line 2364: handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
line 2365: the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
line 2366: constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
line 2367: accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
line 2368: informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
line 2369: resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
line 2370: to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
line 2371: 
line 2372: “Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
line 2373: court.”
line 2374: 
line 2375: “Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
line 2376: and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
line 2377: British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
line 2378: with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
line 2379: offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
line 2380: to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
line 2381: her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
line 2382: elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
line 2383: her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
line 2384: it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
line 2385: pay.”
line 2386: 
line 2387: “You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you
line 2388: that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
line 2389: whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
line 2390: moment, or are the result of previous study?”
line 2391: 
line 2392: “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
line 2393: sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
line 2394: compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
line 2395: give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
line 2396: 
line 2397: Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
line 2398: as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
line 2399: maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
line 2400: and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
line 2401: in his pleasure.
line 2402: 
line 2403: By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
line 2404: to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
line 2405: glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
line 2406: assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
line 2407: announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
line 2408: begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
line 2409: him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
line 2410: deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
line 2411: volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
line 2412: pages, she interrupted him with:
line 2413: 
line 2414: “Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
line 2415: Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
line 2416: so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
line 2417: about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
line 2418: 
line 2419: Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
line 2420: Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
line 2421: 
line 2422: “I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
line 2423: of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
line 2424: me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
line 2425: them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”
line 2426: 
line 2427: Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
line 2428: backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
line 2429: very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
line 2430: Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
line 2431: interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
line 2432: resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
line 2433: young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
line 2434: affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
line 2435: for backgammon.
line 2436: 
line 2437: 
line 2438: 
line 2439: Chapter 15
line 2440: 
line 2441: 
line 2442: Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
line 2443: been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
line 2444: of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
line 2445: miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
line 2446: had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
line 2447: acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
line 2448: given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
line 2449: good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
line 2450: retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
line 2451: prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
line 2452: Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
line 2453: he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
line 2454: mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
line 2455: clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
line 2456: pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
line 2457: 
line 2458: Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
line 2459: marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
line 2460: a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
line 2461: them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
line 2462: This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
line 2463: estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
line 2464: suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
line 2465: part.
line 2466: 
line 2467: His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
line 2468: confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
line 2469: was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
line 2470: choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
line 2471: quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
line 2472: conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
line 2473: to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
line 2474: Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
line 2475: encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to
line 2476: her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
line 2477: not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
line 2478: _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
line 2479: to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
line 2480: 
line 2481: Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
line 2482: done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
line 2483: next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
line 2484: 
line 2485: Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
line 2486: two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
line 2487: the day before was now high in her good graces.
line 2488: 
line 2489: Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
line 2490: except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
line 2491: at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
line 2492: and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
line 2493: him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
line 2494: one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
line 2495: Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
line 2496: doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
line 2497: always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
line 2498: Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
line 2499: house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
line 2500: was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
line 2501: walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
line 2502: than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.
line 2503: 
line 2504: In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
line 2505: cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
line 2506: the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
line 2507: immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
line 2508: nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
line 2509: a shop window, could recall them.
line 2510: 
line 2511: But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
line 2512: they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
line 2513: with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
line 2514: the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
line 2515: to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
line 2516: stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
line 2517: determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
line 2518: pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
line 2519: had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
line 2520: reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
line 2521: permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
line 2522: him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
line 2523: commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
line 2524: young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
line 2525: His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
line 2526: beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
line 2527: The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
line 2528: of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
line 2529: unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
line 2530: very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
line 2531: and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
line 2532: ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
line 2533: began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
line 2534: Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
line 2535: Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
line 2536: it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
line 2537: on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
line 2538: stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
line 2539: looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
line 2540: Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
line 2541: after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
line 2542: deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
line 2543: imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
line 2544: 
line 2545: In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
line 2546: passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
line 2547: 
line 2548: Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
line 2549: Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
line 2550: pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
line 2551: Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
line 2552: invitation.
line 2553: 
line 2554: Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
line 2555: from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
line 2556: eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
line 2557: their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
line 2558: about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
line 2559: street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
line 2560: Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
line 2561: was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She
line 2562: received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
line 2563: as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
line 2564: acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
line 2565: however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
line 2566: introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
line 2567: excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
line 2568: put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
line 2569: however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
line 2570: Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
line 2571: lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
line 2572: last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
line 2573: Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
line 2574: occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
line 2575: officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
line 2576: disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
line 2577: the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
line 2578: Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
line 2579: would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
line 2580: protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
line 2581: tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
line 2582: delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
line 2583: Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
line 2584: with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
line 2585: 
line 2586: As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
line 2587: between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
line 2588: or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
line 2589: such behaviour than her sister.
line 2590: 
line 2591: Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
line 2592: Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
line 2593: Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
line 2594: for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
line 2595: pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
line 2596: utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
line 2597: attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
line 2598: much attention in the whole course of his life.
line 2599: 
line 2600: 
line 2601: 
line 2602: Chapter 16
line 2603: 
line 2604: 
line 2605: As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
line 2606: aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
line 2607: a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
line 2608: conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
line 2609: the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
line 2610: that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
line 2611: the house.
line 2612: 
line 2613: When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
line 2614: Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
line 2615: struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
line 2616: might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
line 2617: parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
line 2618: gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
line 2619: Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
line 2620: description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
line 2621: that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
line 2622: the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
line 2623: with the housekeeper's room.
line 2624: 
line 2625: In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
line 2626: with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
line 2627: the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
line 2628: gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
line 2629: listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
line 2630: heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
line 2631: soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
line 2632: and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
line 2633: their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
line 2634: interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
line 2635: The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
line 2636: Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
line 2637: of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
line 2638: The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
line 2639: gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
line 2640: Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
line 2641: walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
line 2642: breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
line 2643: 
line 2644: Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
line 2645: turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
line 2646: himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
line 2647: conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
line 2648: that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
line 2649: interesting by the skill of the speaker.
line 2650: 
line 2651: With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
line 2652: officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
line 2653: ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
line 2654: listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
line 2655: supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
line 2656: had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
line 2657: 
line 2658: “I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad
line 2659: to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very
line 2660: glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
line 2661: 
line 2662: Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
line 2663: received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
line 2664: seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
line 2665: determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
line 2666: she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
line 2667: and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
line 2668: Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
line 2669: at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
line 2670: him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
line 2671: told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
line 2672: even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
line 2673: relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
line 2674: Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
line 2675: a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
line 2676: 
line 2677: “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
line 2678: drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
line 2679: understand.”
line 2680: 
line 2681: “Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear
line 2682: ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
line 2683: capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
line 2684: I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
line 2685: infancy.”
line 2686: 
line 2687: Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
line 2688: 
line 2689: “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
line 2690: seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
line 2691: yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
line 2692: 
line 2693: “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have
line 2694: spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
line 2695: disagreeable.”
line 2696: 
line 2697: “I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
line 2698: agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
line 2699: too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
line 2700: to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
line 2701: astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
line 2702: anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”
line 2703: 
line 2704: “Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
line 2705: the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
line 2706: Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
line 2707: him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
line 2708: 
line 2709: “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
line 2710: interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
line 2711: their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
line 2712: world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
line 2713: high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”
line 2714: 
line 2715: “I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
line 2716: ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.
line 2717: 
line 2718: “I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
line 2719: likely to be in this country much longer.”
line 2720: 
line 2721: “I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
line 2722: was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
line 2723: not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
line 2724: 
line 2725: “Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
line 2726: wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
line 2727: and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
line 2728: avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
line 2729: of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
line 2730: is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
line 2731: that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
line 2732: be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
line 2733: a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
line 2734: scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
line 2735: everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
line 2736: memory of his father.”
line 2737: 
line 2738: Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
line 2739: all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
line 2740: 
line 2741: Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
line 2742: neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
line 2743: he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
line 2744: intelligible gallantry.
line 2745: 
line 2746: “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
line 2747: “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
line 2748: a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
line 2749: further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
line 2750: attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
line 2751: Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
line 2752: my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
line 2753: A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
line 2754: now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
line 2755: was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
line 2756: possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
line 2757: were speaking of just now.”
line 2758: 
line 2759: “Indeed!”
line 2760: 
line 2761: “Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
line 2762: living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
line 2763: I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
line 2764: and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
line 2765: elsewhere.”
line 2766: 
line 2767: “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his
line 2768: will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”
line 2769: 
line 2770: “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
line 2771: give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
line 2772: intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
line 2773: conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
line 2774: to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
line 2775: it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
line 2776: of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
line 2777: less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
line 2778: anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
line 2779: I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
line 2780: recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
line 2781: of men, and that he hates me.”
line 2782: 
line 2783: “This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
line 2784: 
line 2785: “Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
line 2786: can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”
line 2787: 
line 2788: Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
line 2789: ever as he expressed them.
line 2790: 
line 2791: “But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can
line 2792: have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
line 2793: 
line 2794: “A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
line 2795: attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
line 2796: less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
line 2797: attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
line 2798: not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
line 2799: of preference which was often given me.”
line 2800: 
line 2801: “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
line 2802: him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
line 2803: despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
line 2804: descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
line 2805: this.”
line 2806: 
line 2807: After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
line 2808: remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
line 2809: his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
line 2810: must be dreadful.”
line 2811: 
line 2812: “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly
line 2813: be just to him.”
line 2814: 
line 2815: Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To
line 2816: treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
line 2817: father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
line 2818: countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself
line 2819: with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
line 2820: connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”
line 2821: 
line 2822: “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
line 2823: part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
line 2824: sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
line 2825: father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
line 2826: appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
line 2827: use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
line 2828: Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
line 2829: intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
line 2830: be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,
line 2831: and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
line 2832: voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
line 2833: be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”
line 2834: 
line 2835: “How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very
line 2836: pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
line 2837: motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
line 2838: dishonesty I must call it.”
line 2839: 
line 2840: “It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may
line 2841: be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
line 2842: connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
line 2843: none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
line 2844: impulses even than pride.”
line 2845: 
line 2846: “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
line 2847: 
line 2848: “Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
line 2849: freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
line 2850: poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what
line 2851: his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
line 2852: to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
line 2853: Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
line 2854: which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
line 2855: careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
line 2856: as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
line 2857: 
line 2858: “What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”
line 2859: 
line 2860: He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
line 2861: speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very
line 2862: proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
line 2863: of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
line 2864: nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
line 2865: and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her
line 2866: home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
line 2867: education.”
line 2868: 
line 2869: After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
line 2870: help reverting once more to the first, and saying:
line 2871: 
line 2872: “I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
line 2873: who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
line 2874: be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
line 2875: know Mr. Bingley?”
line 2876: 
line 2877: “Not at all.”
line 2878: 
line 2879: “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
line 2880: Darcy is.”
line 2881: 
line 2882: “Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
line 2883: want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
line 2884: his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
line 2885: a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
line 2886: pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
line 2887: sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
line 2888: for fortune and figure.”
line 2889: 
line 2890: The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
line 2891: the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
line 2892: Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
line 2893: made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
line 2894: point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
line 2895: he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
line 2896: importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
line 2897: that she would not make herself uneasy.
line 2898: 
line 2899: “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
line 2900: card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
line 2901: am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
line 2902: are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
line 2903: Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
line 2904: little matters.”
line 2905: 
line 2906: Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
line 2907: a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
line 2908: was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
line 2909: 
line 2910: “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him
line 2911: a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
line 2912: notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”
line 2913: 
line 2914: “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
line 2915: were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”
line 2916: 
line 2917: “No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
line 2918: connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
line 2919: yesterday.”
line 2920: 
line 2921: “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
line 2922: believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
line 2923: 
line 2924: This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
line 2925: Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
line 2926: affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
line 2927: self-destined for another.
line 2928: 
line 2929: “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
line 2930: daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
line 2931: I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
line 2932: patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
line 2933: 
line 2934: “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have
line 2935: not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
line 2936: her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
line 2937: reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
line 2938: she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
line 2939: her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
line 2940: nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
line 2941: understanding of the first class.”
line 2942: 
line 2943: Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
line 2944: they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
line 2945: put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
line 2946: Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
line 2947: of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to
line 2948: everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
line 2949: gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
line 2950: think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
line 2951: the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
line 2952: as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
line 2953: talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
line 2954: fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
line 2955: Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
line 2956: at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
line 2957: that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
line 2958: before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
line 2959: 
line 2960: 
line 2961: 
line 2962: Chapter 17
line 2963: 
line 2964: 
line 2965: Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
line 2966: Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
line 2967: knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
line 2968: Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
line 2969: veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
line 2970: possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
line 2971: interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
line 2972: done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
line 2973: and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
line 2974: otherwise explained.
line 2975: 
line 2976: “They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way
line 2977: or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
line 2978: misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
line 2979: conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
line 2980: without actual blame on either side.”
line 2981: 
line 2982: “Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
line 2983: behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
line 2984: business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
line 2985: somebody.”
line 2986: 
line 2987: “Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
line 2988: opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
line 2989: it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such
line 2990: a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
line 2991: impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
line 2992: character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
line 2993: excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”
line 2994: 
line 2995: “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than
line 2996: that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
line 2997: last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
line 2998: be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
line 2999: looks.”
line 3000: 
line 3001: “It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
line 3002: think.”
line 3003: 
line 3004: “I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”
line 3005: 
line 3006: But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
line 3007: if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
line 3008: became public.
line 3009: 
line 3010: The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
line 3011: conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
line 3012: been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
line 3013: invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
line 3014: for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
line 3015: dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
line 3016: asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
line 3017: the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
line 3018: as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
line 3019: the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
line 3020: activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
line 3021: eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.
line 3022: 
line 3023: The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
line 3024: female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
line 3025: compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
line 3026: by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
line 3027: ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
line 3028: society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
line 3029: Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
line 3030: Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look
line 3031: and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
line 3032: less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
line 3033: each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
line 3034: he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
line 3035: was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
line 3036: had no disinclination for it.
line 3037: 
line 3038: “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I
line 3039: think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
line 3040: Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
line 3041: who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
line 3042: everybody.”
line 3043: 
line 3044: Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
line 3045: not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
line 3046: him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if
line 3047: he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
line 3048: amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
line 3049: scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
line 3050: either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
line 3051: dance.
line 3052: 
line 3053: “I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball
line 3054: of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
line 3055: can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
line 3056: myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
line 3057: cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
line 3058: soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
line 3059: a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
line 3060: cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
line 3061: 
line 3062: Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
line 3063: engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
line 3064: instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
line 3065: for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce
line 3066: delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
line 3067: good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
line 3068: gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
line 3069: struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
line 3070: of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
line 3071: quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
line 3072: The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
line 3073: civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
line 3074: compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
line 3075: gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
line 3076: her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
line 3077: was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
line 3078: to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
line 3079: consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
line 3080: till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
line 3081: 
line 3082: If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
line 3083: younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
line 3084: time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
line 3085: was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
line 3086: once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
line 3087: shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
line 3088: found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
line 3089: improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
line 3090: a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
line 3091: Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
line 3092: 
line 3093: 
line 3094: 
line 3095: Chapter 18
line 3096: 
line 3097: 
line 3098: Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
line 3099: vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
line 3100: doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
line 3101: of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
line 3102: might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
line 3103: usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
line 3104: that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
line 3105: might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
line 3106: the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
line 3107: pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though
line 3108: this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
line 3109: pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
line 3110: told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
line 3111: day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
line 3112: “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
line 3113: he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”
line 3114: 
line 3115: This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
line 3116: Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
line 3117: Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
line 3118: feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
line 3119: disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
line 3120: the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
line 3121: Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
line 3122: was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
line 3123: with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
line 3124: speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
line 3125: 
line 3126: But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
line 3127: of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
line 3128: spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
line 3129: not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
line 3130: to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
line 3131: notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
line 3132: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
line 3133: apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
line 3134: aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
line 3135: partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
line 3136: him was ecstasy.
line 3137: 
line 3138: She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
line 3139: Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
line 3140: were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
line 3141: her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
line 3142: her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
line 3143: without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
line 3144: immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
line 3145: mind; Charlotte tried to console her:
line 3146: 
line 3147: “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
line 3148: 
line 3149: “Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
line 3150: a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
line 3151: evil.”
line 3152: 
line 3153: When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
line 3154: hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
line 3155: simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
line 3156: in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
line 3157: answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
line 3158: she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
line 3159: reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding
line 3160: it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
line 3161: imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
line 3162: first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
line 3163: be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
line 3164: some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
line 3165: silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
line 3166: with:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
line 3167: about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
line 3168: of the room, or the number of couples.”
line 3169: 
line 3170: He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
line 3171: said.
line 3172: 
line 3173: “Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
line 3174: observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
line 3175: _now_ we may be silent.”
line 3176: 
line 3177: “Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
line 3178: 
line 3179: “Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
line 3180: entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
line 3181: _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
line 3182: trouble of saying as little as possible.”
line 3183: 
line 3184: “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
line 3185: imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
line 3186: 
line 3187: “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great
line 3188: similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
line 3189: taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
line 3190: something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
line 3191: posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”
line 3192: 
line 3193: “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”
line 3194:  said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
line 3195: think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”
line 3196: 
line 3197: “I must not decide on my own performance.”
line 3198: 
line 3199: He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
line 3200: the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
line 3201: walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
line 3202: the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just
line 3203: been forming a new acquaintance.”
line 3204: 
line 3205: The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
line 3206: features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
line 3207: for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
line 3208: constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
line 3209: as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
line 3210: _retaining_ them, is less certain.”
line 3211: 
line 3212: “He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied Elizabeth
line 3213: with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
line 3214: his life.”
line 3215: 
line 3216: Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
line 3217: that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
line 3218: through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
line 3219: Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
line 3220: his dancing and his partner.
line 3221: 
line 3222: “I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
line 3223: superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
line 3224: first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
line 3225: disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
line 3226: especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
line 3227: her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
line 3228: flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
line 3229: will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
line 3230: young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
line 3231: 
line 3232: The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
line 3233: William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
line 3234: eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
line 3235: Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
line 3236: he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William's interruption has made
line 3237: me forget what we were talking of.”
line 3238: 
line 3239: “I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
line 3240: interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
line 3241: We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
line 3242: are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
line 3243: 
line 3244: “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
line 3245: 
line 3246: “Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
line 3247: feelings.”
line 3248: 
line 3249: “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
line 3250: no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”
line 3251: 
line 3252: “No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
line 3253: something else.”
line 3254: 
line 3255: “The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
line 3256: with a look of doubt.
line 3257: 
line 3258: “Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
line 3259: thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
line 3260: by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
line 3261: that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
line 3262: unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
line 3263: created_.”
line 3264: 
line 3265: “I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
line 3266: 
line 3267: “And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
line 3268: 
line 3269: “I hope not.”
line 3270: 
line 3271: “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
line 3272: to be secure of judging properly at first.”
line 3273: 
line 3274: “May I ask to what these questions tend?”
line 3275: 
line 3276: “Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
line 3277: to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”
line 3278: 
line 3279: “And what is your success?”
line 3280: 
line 3281: She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different
line 3282: accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
line 3283: 
line 3284: “I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary
line 3285: greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
line 3286: not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
line 3287: fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”
line 3288: 
line 3289: “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
line 3290: opportunity.”
line 3291: 
line 3292: “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
line 3293: She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
line 3294: silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
line 3295: for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
line 3296: her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
line 3297: another.
line 3298: 
line 3299: They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
line 3300: with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
line 3301: 
line 3302: “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
line 3303: Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
line 3304: questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
line 3305: his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
line 3306: Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
line 3307: give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's
line 3308: using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
line 3309: always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
line 3310: Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
line 3311: I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
line 3312: cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
line 3313: thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
line 3314: the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
line 3315: out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
line 3316: thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
line 3317: Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,
line 3318: considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”
line 3319: 
line 3320: “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said
line 3321: Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
line 3322: than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
line 3323: assure you, he informed me himself.”
line 3324: 
line 3325: “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
line 3326: “Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”
line 3327: 
line 3328: “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken
line 3329: if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
line 3330: nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
line 3331: Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
line 3332: inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
line 3333: such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
line 3334: marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
line 3335: Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
line 3336: Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
line 3337: before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.
line 3338: 
line 3339: “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
line 3340: sister's, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
line 3341: been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
line 3342: you may be sure of my pardon.”
line 3343: 
line 3344: “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
line 3345: satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
line 3346: his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
line 3347: principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
line 3348: the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
line 3349: Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
line 3350: received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,
line 3351: Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
line 3352: been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.”
line 3353: 
line 3354: “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”
line 3355: 
line 3356: “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
line 3357: 
line 3358: “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
line 3359: satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”
line 3360: 
line 3361: “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
line 3362: them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
line 3363: him _conditionally_ only.”
line 3364: 
line 3365: “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;
line 3366: “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
line 3367: Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
line 3368: since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
line 3369: the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
line 3370: both gentlemen as I did before.”
line 3371: 
line 3372: She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
line 3373: which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
line 3374: delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
line 3375: Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
line 3376: in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
line 3377: to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
line 3378: partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
line 3379: and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
line 3380: to make a most important discovery.
line 3381: 
line 3382: “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
line 3383: in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
line 3384: gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
line 3385: the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
line 3386: Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
line 3387: thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
line 3388: Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
line 3389: in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
line 3390: do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
line 3391: ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
line 3392: 
line 3393: “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”
line 3394: 
line 3395: “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
line 3396: I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
line 3397: assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.”
line 3398: 
line 3399: Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
line 3400: that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
line 3401: as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
line 3402: it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
line 3403: side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
line 3404: consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
line 3405: with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
line 3406: ceased speaking, replied thus:
line 3407: 
line 3408: “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
line 3409: your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
line 3410: understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
line 3411: difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
line 3412: and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
line 3413: I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
line 3414: the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
line 3415: behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
line 3416: follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
line 3417: perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
line 3418: profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
line 3419: guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
line 3420: education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
line 3421: lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
line 3422: Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
line 3423: astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
line 3424: his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
line 3425: it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
line 3426: words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed
line 3427: her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
line 3428: with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
line 3429: to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
line 3430: was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
line 3431: abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
line 3432: end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
line 3433: Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
line 3434: 
line 3435: “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
line 3436: reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
line 3437: me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
line 3438: that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
line 3439: certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
line 3440: handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”
line 3441: 
line 3442: As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
line 3443: her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
line 3444: train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
line 3445: made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
line 3446: that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
line 3447: could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
line 3448: endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
line 3449: she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
line 3450: venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
line 3451: supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
line 3452: placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
line 3453: that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
line 3454: openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
line 3455: be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
line 3456: seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
line 3457: match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
line 3458: three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
line 3459: then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
line 3460: Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
line 3461: she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
line 3462: daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
line 3463: other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
line 3464: able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
line 3465: she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
line 3466: necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
line 3467: such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
line 3468: Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
line 3469: concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
line 3470: fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
line 3471: chance of it.
line 3472: 
line 3473: In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
line 3474: words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
line 3475: whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
line 3476: chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
line 3477: mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
line 3478: 
line 3479: “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
line 3480: sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
line 3481: nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”
line 3482: 
line 3483: “For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
line 3484: to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
line 3485: so doing!”
line 3486: 
line 3487: Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
line 3488: talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
line 3489: blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
line 3490: glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
line 3491: she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
line 3492: convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
line 3493: of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
line 3494: steady gravity.
line 3495: 
line 3496: At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
line 3497: had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
line 3498: likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
line 3499: chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
line 3500: tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
line 3501: she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
line 3502: preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
line 3503: entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
line 3504: but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
line 3505: exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's
line 3506: eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
line 3507: progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
line 3508: ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
line 3509: of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
line 3510: favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
line 3511: Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
line 3512: weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
line 3513: Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
line 3514: Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
line 3515: of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
line 3516: imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
line 3517: interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
line 3518: and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do
line 3519: extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
line 3520: young ladies have time to exhibit.”
line 3521: 
line 3522: Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
line 3523: Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
line 3524: her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
line 3525: 
line 3526: “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
line 3527: should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
line 3528: air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
line 3529: compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
line 3530: to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
line 3531: to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
line 3532: rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
line 3533: such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
line 3534: offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
line 3535: that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
line 3536: and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
line 3537: as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
line 3538: that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
line 3539: especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
line 3540: him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
line 3541: occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
line 3542: family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
line 3543: been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
line 3544: smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
line 3545: wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
line 3546: and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
line 3547: clever, good kind of young man.
line 3548: 
line 3549: To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
line 3550: expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
line 3551: have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
line 3552: finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
line 3553: that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
line 3554: feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
line 3555: must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
line 3556: have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
line 3557: and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
line 3558: gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
line 3559: 
line 3560: The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
line 3561: Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
line 3562: he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
line 3563: power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
line 3564: somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
line 3565: He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
line 3566: that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
line 3567: her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
line 3568: the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
line 3569: her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
line 3570: good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.
line 3571: 
line 3572: She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;
line 3573: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
line 3574: disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
line 3575: probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
line 3576: it.
line 3577: 
line 3578: The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
line 3579: a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
line 3580: an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
line 3581: heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
line 3582: sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
line 3583: were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
line 3584: every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
line 3585: languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
line 3586: long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
line 3587: sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
line 3588: politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
line 3589: nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
line 3590: Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
line 3591: rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
line 3592: silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
line 3593: much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
line 3594: how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.
line 3595: 
line 3596: When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
line 3597: civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
line 3598: addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
line 3599: would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
line 3600: the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
line 3601: and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
line 3602: her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
line 3603: day for a short time.
line 3604: 
line 3605: Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
line 3606: delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
line 3607: settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
line 3608: see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
line 3609: months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
line 3610: with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
line 3611: Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
line 3612: man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
line 3613: was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
line 3614: 
line 3615: 
line 3616: 
line 3617: Chapter 19
line 3618: 
line 3619: 
line 3620: The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
line 3621: declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
line 3622: his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
line 3623: no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
line 3624: the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
line 3625: observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
line 3626: finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
line 3627: soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:
line 3628: 
line 3629: “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
line 3630: when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
line 3631: course of this morning?”
line 3632: 
line 3633: Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
line 3634: Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
line 3635: will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
line 3636: want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
line 3637: away, when Elizabeth called out:
line 3638: 
line 3639: “Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
line 3640: me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
line 3641: going away myself.”
line 3642: 
line 3643: “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon
line 3644: Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
line 3645: escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
line 3646: Collins.”
line 3647: 
line 3648: Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
line 3649: consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
line 3650: over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
line 3651: conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
line 3652: distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
line 3653: they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
line 3654: 
line 3655: “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
line 3656: doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
line 3657: would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
line 3658: unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
line 3659: mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
line 3660: purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
line 3661: dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
line 3662: soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
line 3663: my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
line 3664: subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
line 3665: marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
line 3666: of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
line 3667: 
line 3668: The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
line 3669: with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
line 3670: not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
line 3671: and he continued:
line 3672: 
line 3673: “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
line 3674: every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
line 3675: of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
line 3676: add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
line 3677: to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
line 3678: recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
line 3679: patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
line 3680: too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
line 3681: left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
line 3682: arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you
line 3683: must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
line 3684: a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
line 3685: useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
line 3686: income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
line 3687: you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
line 3688: way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
line 3689: and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
line 3690: advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
line 3691: anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
line 3692: acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
line 3693: respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
line 3694: intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
line 3695: were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
line 3696: can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
line 3697: being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
line 3698: father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
line 3699: myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
line 3700: the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
line 3701: event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
line 3702: be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
line 3703: I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
line 3704: remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
line 3705: violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
line 3706: shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
line 3707: aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
line 3708: in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's
line 3709: decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
line 3710: therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
line 3711: no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
line 3712: 
line 3713: It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
line 3714: 
line 3715: “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no
line 3716: answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
line 3717: the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
line 3718: your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
line 3719: decline them.”
line 3720: 
line 3721: “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
line 3722: hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
line 3723: man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
line 3724: favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
line 3725: third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
line 3726: said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
line 3727: 
line 3728: “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather
line 3729: extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
line 3730: one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
line 3731: daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
line 3732: time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
line 3733: happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
line 3734: could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
line 3735: am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
line 3736: situation.”
line 3737: 
line 3738: “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins
line 3739: very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
line 3740: disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
line 3741: seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
line 3742: modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”
line 3743: 
line 3744: “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
line 3745: must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
line 3746: of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
line 3747: refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
line 3748: In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
line 3749: feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
line 3750: estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
line 3751: be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she
line 3752: thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
line 3753: addressed her:
line 3754: 
line 3755: “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
line 3756: shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
line 3757: me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
line 3758: know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
line 3759: the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
line 3760: encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
line 3761: female character.”
line 3762: 
line 3763: “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me
line 3764: exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
line 3765: of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
line 3766: to convince you of its being one.”
line 3767: 
line 3768: “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
line 3769: refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
line 3770: believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
line 3771: unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
line 3772: be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
line 3773: with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
line 3774: circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
line 3775: consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
line 3776: means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
line 3777: portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
line 3778: the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
line 3779: therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
line 3780: I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
line 3781: suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
line 3782: 
line 3783: “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
line 3784: of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
line 3785: rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
line 3786: again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
line 3787: to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
line 3788: forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
line 3789: female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
line 3790: the truth from her heart.”
line 3791: 
line 3792: “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
line 3793: gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
line 3794: authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
line 3795: being acceptable.”
line 3796: 
line 3797: To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
line 3798: no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
line 3799: he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
line 3800: encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
line 3801: in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
line 3802: not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
line 3803: 
line 3804: 
line 3805: 
line 3806: Chapter 20
line 3807: 
line 3808: 
line 3809: Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
line 3810: successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
line 3811: to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
line 3812: the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
line 3813: entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
line 3814: warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
line 3815: received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
line 3816: proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
line 3817: of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
line 3818: refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
line 3819: from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
line 3820: 
line 3821: This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
line 3822: glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
line 3823: him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
line 3824: and could not help saying so.
line 3825: 
line 3826: “But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
line 3827: brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
line 3828: headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
line 3829: _make_ her know it.”
line 3830: 
line 3831: “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if
line 3832: she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
line 3833: altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
line 3834: naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
line 3835: actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
line 3836: to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
line 3837: temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
line 3838: 
line 3839: “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is
line 3840: only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
line 3841: good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
line 3842: we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
line 3843: 
line 3844: She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
line 3845: husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
line 3846: are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
line 3847: Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
line 3848: do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”
line 3849: 
line 3850: Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
line 3851: on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
line 3852: her communication.
line 3853: 
line 3854: “I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
line 3855: finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”
line 3856: 
line 3857: “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
line 3858: and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
line 3859: 
line 3860: “And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”
line 3861: 
line 3862: “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
line 3863: marrying him.”
line 3864: 
line 3865: “Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
line 3866: 
line 3867: Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
line 3868: library.
line 3869: 
line 3870: “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for
line 3871: you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
line 3872: you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.
line 3873: “Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
line 3874: 
line 3875: “I have, sir.”
line 3876: 
line 3877: “Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
line 3878: accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
line 3879: 
line 3880: “Yes, or I will never see her again.”
line 3881: 
line 3882: “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
line 3883: be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
line 3884: again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
line 3885: if you _do_.”
line 3886: 
line 3887: Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
line 3888: but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
line 3889: affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
line 3890: 
line 3891: “What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
line 3892: _insist_ upon her marrying him.”
line 3893: 
line 3894: “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
line 3895: First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
line 3896: present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
line 3897: library to myself as soon as may be.”
line 3898: 
line 3899: Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
line 3900: Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
line 3901: coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
line 3902: in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
line 3903: interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
line 3904: sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
line 3905: varied, however, her determination never did.
line 3906: 
line 3907: Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
line 3908: He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
line 3909: could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
line 3910: way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
line 3911: deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
line 3912: 
line 3913: While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
line 3914: the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
line 3915: her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
line 3916: fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
line 3917: made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”
line 3918: 
line 3919: Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
line 3920: who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
line 3921: breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
line 3922: the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
line 3923: her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
line 3924: family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,
line 3925: “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
line 3926: nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
line 3927: 
line 3928: Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
line 3929: 
line 3930: “Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned
line 3931: as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
line 3932: she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
line 3933: into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
line 3934: you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
line 3935: to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
line 3936: you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
line 3937: you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
line 3938: and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
line 3939: to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
line 3940: to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
line 3941: no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
line 3942: is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”
line 3943: 
line 3944: Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
line 3945: any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
line 3946: irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
line 3947: them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
line 3948: an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
line 3949: the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
line 3950: your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
line 3951: together.”
line 3952: 
line 3953: Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
line 3954: Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
line 3955: detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
line 3956: herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
line 3957: curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
line 3958: not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
line 3959: conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”
line 3960: 
line 3961: “My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
line 3962: Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
line 3963: displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
line 3964: to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
line 3965: young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
line 3966: and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
line 3967: of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
line 3968: for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
line 3969: when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
line 3970: estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
line 3971: to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
line 3972: your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
line 3973: compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
line 3974: behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
line 3975: dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all
line 3976: liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
line 3977: My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
line 3978: consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
line 3979: has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”
line 3980: 
line 3981: 
line 3982: 
line 3983: Chapter 21
line 3984: 
line 3985: 
line 3986: The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
line 3987: Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
line 3988: attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
line 3989: mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
line 3990: expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
line 3991: but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
line 3992: to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
line 3993: himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
line 3994: civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
line 3995: especially to her friend.
line 3996: 
line 3997: The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill
line 3998: health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
line 3999: had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
line 4000: not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
line 4001: Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
line 4002: 
line 4003: After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
line 4004: were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
line 4005: He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
line 4006: aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
line 4007: well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
line 4008: that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
line 4009: 
line 4010: “I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet
line 4011: Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
line 4012: many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
line 4013: might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
line 4014: 
line 4015: She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
line 4016: discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
line 4017: bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
line 4018: them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
line 4019: her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
line 4020: compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
line 4021: occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
line 4022: 
line 4023: Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
line 4024: from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
line 4025: hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
line 4026: Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw
line 4027: her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
line 4028: herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
line 4029: cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
line 4030: on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
line 4031: sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
line 4032: invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
line 4033: Jane, taking out the letter, said:
line 4034: 
line 4035: “This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
line 4036: deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
line 4037: their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
line 4038: shall hear what she says.”
line 4039: 
line 4040: She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
line 4041: of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
line 4042: and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
line 4043: house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything
line 4044: I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
line 4045: but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
line 4046: delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
line 4047: lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
line 4048: correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown
line 4049: expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
line 4050: and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
line 4051: nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
line 4052: absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
line 4053: to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
line 4054: regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
line 4055: 
line 4056: “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
line 4057: able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
line 4058: hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
line 4059: forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
line 4060: intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
line 4061: satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
line 4062: them.”
line 4063: 
line 4064: “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
line 4065: Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”
line 4066: 
line 4067: “When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
line 4068: took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
line 4069: are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
line 4070: Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
line 4071: determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
line 4072: his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
line 4073: already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
line 4074: dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
line 4075: that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
line 4076: abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
line 4077: beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
line 4078: three of whom we shall deprive you.”
line 4079: 
line 4080: “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
line 4081: winter.”
line 4082: 
line 4083: “It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.”
line 4084: 
line 4085: “Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
line 4086: master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
line 4087: particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”
line 4088: 
line 4089: “Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
line 4090: _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
line 4091: Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
line 4092: and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
line 4093: something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
line 4094: her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
line 4095: mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
line 4096: country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
line 4097: unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
line 4098: frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
line 4099: her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
line 4100: partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
line 4101: capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
line 4102: favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
line 4103: Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
line 4104: of so many?”
line 4105: 
line 4106: “What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she
line 4107: finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
line 4108: Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
line 4109: perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she
line 4110: suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
line 4111: put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”
line 4112: 
line 4113: “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”
line 4114: 
line 4115: “Most willingly.”
line 4116: 
line 4117: “You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
line 4118: in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
line 4119: to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
line 4120: does not care about you.”
line 4121: 
line 4122: Jane shook her head.
line 4123: 
line 4124: “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
line 4125: together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
line 4126: is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
line 4127: Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
line 4128: case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
line 4129: is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
line 4130: that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
line 4131: in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
line 4132: I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
line 4133: my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
line 4134: tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
line 4135: degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
line 4136: Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
line 4137: of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”
line 4138: 
line 4139: “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your
line 4140: representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
line 4141: foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
line 4142: anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
line 4143: herself.”
line 4144: 
line 4145: “That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
line 4146: will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
line 4147: You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”
line 4148: 
line 4149: “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
line 4150: accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
line 4151: elsewhere?”
line 4152: 
line 4153: “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
line 4154: deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
line 4155: more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
line 4156: all means to refuse him.”
line 4157: 
line 4158: “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that
line 4159: though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
line 4160: not hesitate.”
line 4161: 
line 4162: “I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
line 4163: your situation with much compassion.”
line 4164: 
line 4165: “But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
line 4166: required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”
line 4167: 
line 4168: The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
line 4169: contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
line 4170: interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
line 4171: wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
line 4172: so totally independent of everyone.
line 4173: 
line 4174: She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
line 4175: on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
line 4176: Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
line 4177: though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
line 4178: Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
line 4179: 
line 4180: They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
line 4181: family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
line 4182: but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
line 4183: and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
line 4184: to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
line 4185: lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
line 4186: Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
line 4187: conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
line 4188: been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
line 4189: full courses.
line 4190: 
line 4191: 
line 4192: 
line 4193: Chapter 22
line 4194: 
line 4195: 
line 4196: The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
line 4197: chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
line 4198: Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good
line 4199: humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”
line 4200:  Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
line 4201: that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
line 4202: very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
line 4203: had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
line 4204: from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
line 4205: herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
line 4206: favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
line 4207: secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
line 4208: soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
line 4209: character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
line 4210: morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
line 4211: himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
line 4212: from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
line 4213: conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
line 4214: till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
line 4215: secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
line 4216: he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
line 4217: His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
line 4218: perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
line 4219: instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
line 4220: she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
line 4221: 
line 4222: In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
line 4223: everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
line 4224: they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
line 4225: was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
line 4226: be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
line 4227: his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
line 4228: guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
line 4229: continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
line 4230: and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
line 4231: establishment were gained.
line 4232: 
line 4233: Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
line 4234: and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
line 4235: circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
line 4236: they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
line 4237: exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
line 4238: interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
line 4239: Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
line 4240: opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
line 4241: Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
line 4242: should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,
line 4243: were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
line 4244: of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
line 4245: done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
line 4246: dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
line 4247: gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
line 4248: in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
line 4249: nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
line 4250: be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
line 4251: either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
line 4252: the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
line 4253: and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
line 4254: preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
line 4255: the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
line 4256: the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
line 4257: was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
line 4258: she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
line 4259: and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
line 4260: shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
line 4261: to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
line 4262: when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
line 4263: passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
line 4264: dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
line 4265: curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
line 4266: questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
line 4267: at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
line 4268: publish his prosperous love.
line 4269: 
line 4270: As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
line 4271: family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
line 4272: for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
line 4273: said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
line 4274: his engagements might allow him to visit them.
line 4275: 
line 4276: “My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
line 4277: gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
line 4278: you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
line 4279: possible.”
line 4280: 
line 4281: They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
line 4282: so speedy a return, immediately said:
line 4283: 
line 4284: “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
line 4285: good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
line 4286: offending your patroness.”
line 4287: 
line 4288: “My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you
line 4289: for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
line 4290: material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.”
line 4291: 
line 4292: “You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
line 4293: displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
line 4294: again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
line 4295: and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”
line 4296: 
line 4297: “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
line 4298: affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
line 4299: from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
line 4300: regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
line 4301: my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
line 4302: take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
line 4303: cousin Elizabeth.”
line 4304: 
line 4305: With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
line 4306: surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
line 4307: understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
line 4308: younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
line 4309: She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
line 4310: a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
line 4311: means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
line 4312: and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
line 4313: agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
line 4314: kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
line 4315: private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
line 4316: 
line 4317: The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her
line 4318: friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
line 4319: that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
line 4320: possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
line 4321: consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
line 4322: she could not help crying out:
line 4323: 
line 4324: “Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”
line 4325: 
line 4326: The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
line 4327: story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
line 4328: reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
line 4329: her composure, and calmly replied:
line 4330: 
line 4331: “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
line 4332: that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
line 4333: because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
line 4334: 
line 4335: But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
line 4336: for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
line 4337: their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
line 4338: all imaginable happiness.
line 4339: 
line 4340: “I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,
line 4341: very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
line 4342: you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
line 4343: satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
line 4344: was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
line 4345: character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
line 4346: chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
line 4347: entering the marriage state.”
line 4348: 
line 4349: Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,
line 4350: they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
line 4351: longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
line 4352: It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
line 4353: unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
line 4354: of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
line 4355: accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was
line 4356: not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
line 4357: that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
line 4358: feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
line 4359: most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
line 4360: and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
line 4361: was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
line 4362: chosen.
line 4363: 
line 4364: 
line 4365: 
line 4366: Chapter 23
line 4367: 
line 4368: 
line 4369: Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
line 4370: she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
line 4371: it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
line 4372: announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
line 4373: and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
line 4374: houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
line 4375: incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
line 4376: protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
line 4377: often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:
line 4378: 
line 4379: “Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
line 4380: that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”
line 4381: 
line 4382: Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
line 4383: without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
line 4384: him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
line 4385: truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
line 4386: most forbearing courtesy.
line 4387: 
line 4388: Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
line 4389: a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
line 4390: mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
line 4391: endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
line 4392: by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
line 4393: was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
line 4394: happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
line 4395: of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
line 4396: 
line 4397: Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
line 4398: Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
line 4399: found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
line 4400: the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
line 4401: had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
line 4402: happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
line 4403: inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
line 4404: Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
line 4405: herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
line 4406: points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
line 4407: console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
line 4408: resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
line 4409: scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
line 4410: or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
line 4411: could at all forgive their daughter.
line 4412: 
line 4413: Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
line 4414: as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
line 4415: it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
line 4416: been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
line 4417: more foolish than his daughter!
line 4418: 
line 4419: Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
line 4420: less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
line 4421: nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
line 4422: and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
line 4423: clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
line 4424: to spread at Meryton.
line 4425: 
line 4426: Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
line 4427: on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
line 4428: called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
line 4429: though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
line 4430: enough to drive happiness away.
line 4431: 
line 4432: Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
line 4433: mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
line 4434: no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
line 4435: disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
line 4436: sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
line 4437: never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
line 4438: as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
line 4439: return.
line 4440: 
line 4441: Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
line 4442: the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
line 4443: letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
line 4444: their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
line 4445: twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
line 4446: his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
line 4447: rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
line 4448: of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
line 4449: merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
line 4450: to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
line 4451: he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
line 4452: he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
line 4453: place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
line 4454: argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
line 4455: the happiest of men.
line 4456: 
line 4457: Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
line 4458: pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
line 4459: complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
line 4460: to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
line 4461: and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
line 4462: while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
line 4463: most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
line 4464: they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
line 4465: absence.
line 4466: 
line 4467: Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
line 4468: day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
line 4469: report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
line 4470: Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
line 4471: Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
line 4472: falsehood.
line 4473: 
line 4474: Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
line 4475: his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
line 4476: she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
line 4477: dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
line 4478: frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
line 4479: and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
line 4480: Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
line 4481: the strength of his attachment.
line 4482: 
line 4483: As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
line 4484: painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
line 4485: concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
line 4486: was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
line 4487: an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
line 4488: impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
line 4489: did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
line 4490: all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
line 4491: tranquillity.
line 4492: 
line 4493: Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
line 4494: reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
line 4495: first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
line 4496: and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
line 4497: from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
line 4498: him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
line 4499: to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
line 4500: 
line 4501: Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
line 4502: anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
line 4503: and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
line 4504: of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
line 4505: regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
line 4506: them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
line 4507: whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
line 4508: they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
line 4509: and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
line 4510: complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
line 4511: 
line 4512: “Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte
line 4513: Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
line 4514: make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”
line 4515: 
line 4516: “My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
line 4517: better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”
line 4518: 
line 4519: This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
line 4520: making any answer, she went on as before.
line 4521: 
line 4522: “I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
line 4523: not for the entail, I should not mind it.”
line 4524: 
line 4525: “What should not you mind?”
line 4526: 
line 4527: “I should not mind anything at all.”
line 4528: 
line 4529: “Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
line 4530: insensibility.”
line 4531: 
line 4532: “I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
line 4533: anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own
line 4534: daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
line 4535: Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”
line 4536: 
line 4537: “I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
line 4538: 
line 4539: 
line 4540: 
line 4541: Chapter 24
line 4542: 
line 4543: 
line 4544: Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
line 4545: sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
line 4546: the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
line 4547: time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
line 4548: the country.
line 4549: 
line 4550: Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
line 4551: of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
line 4552: writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
line 4553: the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
line 4554: boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
line 4555: the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
line 4556: letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
line 4557: inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
line 4558: the latter with regard to new furniture.
line 4559: 
line 4560: Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
line 4561: heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
line 4562: for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's
line 4563: assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
line 4564: credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
line 4565: had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
line 4566: could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
line 4567: of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
line 4568: of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
line 4569: to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
line 4570: been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
line 4571: whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as
line 4572: she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
line 4573: on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
line 4574: could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
line 4575: died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether
line 4576: he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
line 4577: observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
line 4578: materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
line 4579: the same, her peace equally wounded.
line 4580: 
line 4581: A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
line 4582: Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
line 4583: longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
line 4584: not help saying:
line 4585: 
line 4586: “Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
line 4587: idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
line 4588: I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
line 4589: all be as we were before.”
line 4590: 
line 4591: Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
line 4592: nothing.
line 4593: 
line 4594: “You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have
line 4595: no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
line 4596: acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
line 4597: and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
line 4598: little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.”
line 4599: 
line 4600: With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
line 4601: that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
line 4602: has done no harm to anyone but myself.”
line 4603: 
line 4604: “My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness
line 4605: and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
line 4606: to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
line 4607: deserve.”
line 4608: 
line 4609: Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
line 4610: the praise on her sister's warm affection.
line 4611: 
line 4612: “Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
line 4613: world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
line 4614: to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
line 4615: be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
line 4616: privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
line 4617: whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
line 4618: of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
line 4619: my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
line 4620: little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
line 4621: sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
line 4622: other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
line 4623: unaccountable!”
line 4624: 
line 4625: “My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
line 4626: ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
line 4627: of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and
line 4628: Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
line 4629: large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
line 4630: ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like
line 4631: regard and esteem for our cousin.”
line 4632: 
line 4633: “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
line 4634: could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
line 4635: Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
line 4636: understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
line 4637: conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
line 4638: I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
line 4639: cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
line 4640: it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
line 4641: change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
line 4642: yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
line 4643: danger security for happiness.”
line 4644: 
line 4645: “I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
line 4646: Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
line 4647: together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
line 4648: mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
line 4649: you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
line 4650: saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
line 4651: ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
line 4652: to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
line 4653: our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
line 4654: it does.”
line 4655: 
line 4656: “And men take care that they should.”
line 4657: 
line 4658: “If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
line 4659: of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
line 4660: 
line 4661: “I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,”
line 4662:  said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
line 4663: unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
line 4664: want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
line 4665: will do the business.”
line 4666: 
line 4667: “And do you impute it to either of those?”
line 4668: 
line 4669: “Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
line 4670: I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”
line 4671: 
line 4672: “You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
line 4673: 
line 4674: “Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
line 4675: 
line 4676: “I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
line 4677: only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
line 4678: secure it.”
line 4679: 
line 4680: “Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
line 4681: happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
line 4682: may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
line 4683: connections, and pride.”
line 4684: 
line 4685: “Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
line 4686: “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
line 4687: known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
line 4688: her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
line 4689: they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think
line 4690: herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
line 4691: objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
line 4692: to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
line 4693: affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
line 4694: unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
line 4695: mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
line 4696: I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
line 4697: the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
line 4698: 
line 4699: Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
line 4700: name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
line 4701: 
line 4702: Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
line 4703: more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
line 4704: for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
line 4705: less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
line 4706: did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
line 4707: effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
line 4708: no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
line 4709: the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
line 4710: comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
line 4711: 
line 4712: Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,
line 4713: “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
line 4714: being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
line 4715: It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
line 4716: among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
line 4717: be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
line 4718: Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
line 4719: be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
line 4720: 
line 4721: “Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
line 4722: all expect Jane's good fortune.”
line 4723: 
line 4724: “True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
line 4725: that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
line 4726: the most of it.”
line 4727: 
line 4728: Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
line 4729: which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
line 4730: family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
line 4731: added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
line 4732: heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
line 4733: was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
line 4734: pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
line 4735: had known anything of the matter.
line 4736: 
line 4737: Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
line 4738: any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
line 4739: of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
line 4740: allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
line 4741: Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
line 4742: 
line 4743: 
line 4744: 
line 4745: Chapter 25
line 4746: 
line 4747: 
line 4748: After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
line 4749: Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
line 4750: Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
line 4751: side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
line 4752: to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
line 4753: be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
line 4754: relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
line 4755: cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
line 4756: letter of thanks.
line 4757: 
line 4758: On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
line 4759: her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
line 4760: at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
line 4761: superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
line 4762: ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
line 4763: by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
line 4764: well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
line 4765: than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
line 4766: woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
line 4767: two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
line 4768: They had frequently been staying with her in town.
line 4769: 
line 4770: The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to
line 4771: distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
line 4772: done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
line 4773: Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
line 4774: had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
line 4775: girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
line 4776: nothing in it.
line 4777: 
line 4778: “I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
line 4779: Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
line 4780: that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not
line 4781: been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
line 4782: and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
line 4783: a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
line 4784: as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
line 4785: sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
line 4786: them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
line 4787: so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
line 4788: before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
line 4789: greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
line 4790: long sleeves.”
line 4791: 
line 4792: Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
line 4793: in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
line 4794: sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
line 4795: conversation.
line 4796: 
line 4797: When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It
line 4798: seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am
line 4799: sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
line 4800: as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
line 4801: for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
line 4802: her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”
line 4803: 
line 4804: “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not
line 4805: do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
line 4806: happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
line 4807: independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
line 4808: love with only a few days before.”
line 4809: 
line 4810: “But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
line 4811: doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
line 4812: often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,
line 4813: as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
line 4814: love?”
line 4815: 
line 4816: “I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
line 4817: inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
line 4818: they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
line 4819: offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
line 4820: spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
line 4821: finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
line 4822: 
line 4823: “Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
line 4824: Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
line 4825: over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
line 4826: would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
line 4827: would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
line 4828: of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
line 4829: anything.”
line 4830: 
line 4831: Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
line 4832: of her sister's ready acquiescence.
line 4833: 
line 4834: “I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
line 4835: this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
line 4836: town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
line 4837: out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
line 4838: unless he really comes to see her.”
line 4839: 
line 4840: “And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
line 4841: friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
line 4842: a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
line 4843: perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
line 4844: would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
line 4845: impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
line 4846: never stirs without him.”
line 4847: 
line 4848: “So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
line 4849: correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”
line 4850: 
line 4851: “She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
line 4852: 
line 4853: But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
line 4854: point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
line 4855: withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
line 4856: convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
line 4857: hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
line 4858: his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
line 4859: successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
line 4860: attractions.
line 4861: 
line 4862: Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
line 4863: Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
line 4864: hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
line 4865: she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
line 4866: seeing him.
line 4867: 
line 4868: The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
line 4869: the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
line 4870: engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
line 4871: of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
line 4872: dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
line 4873: made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
line 4874: on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
line 4875: warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
line 4876: from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
line 4877: of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
line 4878: she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
line 4879: Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
line 4880: an attachment.
line 4881: 
line 4882: To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
line 4883: unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
line 4884: before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
line 4885: part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
line 4886: acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
line 4887: the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
line 4888: intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
line 4889: procuring.
line 4890: 
line 4891: Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
line 4892: character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
line 4893: of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
line 4894: description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
line 4895: praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
line 4896: him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's
line 4897: treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's
line 4898: reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
line 4899: was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
line 4900: Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
line 4901: 
line 4902: 
line 4903: 
line 4904: Chapter 26
line 4905: 
line 4906: 
line 4907: Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
line 4908: on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
line 4909: honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
line 4910: 
line 4911: “You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
line 4912: you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
line 4913: openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
line 4914: yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
line 4915: of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
line 4916: _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
line 4917: ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
line 4918: must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
line 4919: expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
line 4920: good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”
line 4921: 
line 4922: “My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
line 4923: 
line 4924: “Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
line 4925: 
line 4926: “Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
line 4927: myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
line 4928: can prevent it.”
line 4929: 
line 4930: “Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
line 4931: 
line 4932: “I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
line 4933: Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
line 4934: the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
line 4935: me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
line 4936: of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does
line 4937: me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
line 4938: father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
line 4939: should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
line 4940: since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
line 4941: are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
line 4942: engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
line 4943: of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
line 4944: would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
line 4945: to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
line 4946: object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
line 4947: I will do my best.”
line 4948: 
line 4949: “Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
line 4950: often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”
line 4951: 
line 4952: “As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very
line 4953: true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
line 4954: that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
line 4955: so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
line 4956: necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
line 4957: honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
line 4958: you are satisfied.”
line 4959: 
line 4960: Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
line 4961: the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
line 4962: being given on such a point, without being resented.
line 4963: 
line 4964: Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
line 4965: by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
line 4966: his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
line 4967: now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
line 4968: it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
line 4969: she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,
line 4970: and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
line 4971: rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
line 4972: reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
line 4973: out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:
line 4974: 
line 4975: “I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”
line 4976: 
line 4977: “_That_ you certainly shall.”
line 4978: 
line 4979: “And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”
line 4980: 
line 4981: “We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”
line 4982: 
line 4983: “I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
line 4984: come to Hunsford.”
line 4985: 
line 4986: Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
line 4987: visit.
line 4988: 
line 4989: “My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I
line 4990: hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
line 4991: welcome as either of them.”
line 4992: 
line 4993: The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
line 4994: the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
line 4995: the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
line 4996: correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
line 4997: it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
line 4998: address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
line 4999: and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
line 5000: sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
line 5001: were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
line 5002: curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
line 5003: like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
line 5004: be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
line 5005: expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
line 5006: wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
line 5007: which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
line 5008: roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
line 5009: friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
line 5010: Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
line 5011: for her own visit there to know the rest.
line 5012: 
line 5013: Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
line 5014: safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
line 5015: would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
line 5016: 
line 5017: Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
line 5018: generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
line 5019: hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
line 5020: her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
line 5021: lost.
line 5022: 
line 5023: “My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
line 5024: town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”
line 5025: 
line 5026: She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
line 5027: “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
line 5028: glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
line 5029: to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
line 5030: her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
line 5031: engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
line 5032: Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
line 5033: not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
line 5034: see them soon here.”
line 5035: 
line 5036: Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
line 5037: accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.
line 5038: 
line 5039: Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
line 5040: persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
line 5041: blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
line 5042: for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
line 5043: visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
line 5044: the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
line 5045: longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
line 5046: prove what she felt.
line 5047: 
line 5048: “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
line 5049: better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
line 5050: entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,
line 5051: though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
line 5052: still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
line 5053: as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
line 5054: wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
line 5055: happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
line 5056: return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
line 5057: receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
line 5058: she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
line 5059: calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
line 5060: in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
line 5061: perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
line 5062: though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
line 5063: as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
line 5064: her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
line 5065: wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
line 5066: cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
line 5067: this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
line 5068: account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
line 5069: his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
line 5070: amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
line 5071: because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
line 5072: He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
line 5073: herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
line 5074: wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
line 5075: cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
line 5076: be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
line 5077: in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
line 5078: and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
line 5079: invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
line 5080: soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
line 5081: again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
line 5082: not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
line 5083: from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
line 5084: Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.”
line 5085: 
line 5086: This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
line 5087: considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
line 5088: All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
line 5089: even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
line 5090: every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
line 5091: advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
line 5092: Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
line 5093: regret what he had thrown away.
line 5094: 
line 5095: Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
line 5096: concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
line 5097: had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
line 5098: herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
line 5099: he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
line 5100: see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
line 5101: Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
line 5102: with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
line 5103: permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
line 5104: remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
line 5105: agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
line 5106: in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
line 5107: Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
line 5108: suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
line 5109: ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
line 5110: sincerely wish him happy.
line 5111: 
line 5112: All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
line 5113: circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
line 5114: I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
line 5115: and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
line 5116: wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
line 5117: towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
line 5118: out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
line 5119: think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
line 5120: watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
line 5121: interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
line 5122: with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
line 5123: Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
line 5124: his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
line 5125: ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
line 5126: handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”
line 5127: 
line 5128: 
line 5129: 
line 5130: Chapter 27
line 5131: 
line 5132: 
line 5133: With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
line 5134: diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
line 5135: sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
line 5136: Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
line 5137: going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
line 5138: and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
line 5139: as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
line 5140: Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
line 5141: was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
line 5142: uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
line 5143: was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
line 5144: a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
line 5145: been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
line 5146: and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was
line 5147: to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
line 5148: of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
line 5149: perfect as plan could be.
line 5150: 
line 5151: The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
line 5152: and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
line 5153: told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
line 5154: 
line 5155: The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
line 5156: his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
line 5157: Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
line 5158: first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
line 5159: of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
line 5160: what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
line 5161: opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
line 5162: was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
line 5163: him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
line 5164: whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
line 5165: and pleasing.
line 5166: 
line 5167: Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
line 5168: think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
line 5169: good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
line 5170: that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
line 5171: delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
line 5172: she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of
line 5173: the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
line 5174: worn out, like his information.
line 5175: 
line 5176: It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
line 5177: as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
line 5178: door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
line 5179: they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
line 5180: looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
line 5181: lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
line 5182: whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
line 5183: wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
line 5184: her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
line 5185: kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
line 5186: shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
line 5187: 
line 5188: Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
line 5189: sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
line 5190: her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
line 5191: spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
line 5192: to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
line 5193: particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and
line 5194: repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
line 5195: herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
line 5196: acquaintance.
line 5197: 
line 5198: Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
line 5199: complimented her on bearing it so well.
line 5200: 
line 5201: “But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I
line 5202: should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
line 5203: 
line 5204: “Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
line 5205: between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
line 5206: and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
line 5207: because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
line 5208: a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
line 5209: mercenary.”
line 5210: 
line 5211: “If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
line 5212: what to think.”
line 5213: 
line 5214: “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”
line 5215: 
line 5216: “But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death
line 5217: made her mistress of this fortune.”
line 5218: 
line 5219: “No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
line 5220: affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
line 5221: making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
line 5222: poor?”
line 5223: 
line 5224: “But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
line 5225: so soon after this event.”
line 5226: 
line 5227: “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
line 5228: decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
line 5229: why should _we_?”
line 5230: 
line 5231: “_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
line 5232: deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
line 5233: 
line 5234: “Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
line 5235: mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
line 5236: 
line 5237: “No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
line 5238: to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
line 5239: 
line 5240: “Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
line 5241: Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
line 5242: much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
line 5243: where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
line 5244: neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
line 5245: worth knowing, after all.”
line 5246: 
line 5247: “Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
line 5248: 
line 5249: Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
line 5250: unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
line 5251: a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
line 5252: 
line 5253: “We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
line 5254: “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”
line 5255: 
line 5256: No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
line 5257: acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear,
line 5258: dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You
line 5259: give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
line 5260: are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
line 5261: we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
line 5262: travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
line 5263: _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
line 5264: Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
line 5265: imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
line 5266: will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
line 5267: first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
line 5268: travellers.”
line 5269: 
line 5270: 
line 5271: 
line 5272: Chapter 28
line 5273: 
line 5274: 
line 5275: Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
line 5276: Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
line 5277: seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
line 5278: and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
line 5279: 
line 5280: When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
line 5281: search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
line 5282: The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
line 5283: smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
line 5284: 
line 5285: At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
line 5286: road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
line 5287: everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
line 5288: appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
line 5289: led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
line 5290: the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
line 5291: at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
line 5292: liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
line 5293: coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
line 5294: instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;
line 5295: his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
line 5296: minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
line 5297: family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
line 5298: neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
line 5299: were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
line 5300: formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's
line 5301: offers of refreshment.
line 5302: 
line 5303: Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
line 5304: in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
line 5305: aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
line 5306: as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
line 5307: though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
line 5308: gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
line 5309: her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
line 5310: When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
line 5311: ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
line 5312: eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
line 5313: in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
line 5314: admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
line 5315: the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
line 5316: happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
line 5317: garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
line 5318: which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
line 5319: respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
line 5320: with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
line 5321: owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
line 5322: through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
line 5323: interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
line 5324: with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
line 5325: fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
line 5326: the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
line 5327: the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
line 5328: prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
line 5329: the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
line 5330: modern building, well situated on rising ground.
line 5331: 
line 5332: From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
line 5333: but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
line 5334: frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
line 5335: took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
line 5336: probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's
line 5337: help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
line 5338: was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
line 5339: Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
line 5340: forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
line 5341: Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
line 5342: forgotten.
line 5343: 
line 5344: She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
line 5345: was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
line 5346: in, observed:
line 5347: 
line 5348: “Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
line 5349: de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
line 5350: be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
line 5351: doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
line 5352: when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
line 5353: will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
line 5354: honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
line 5355: charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
line 5356: to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
line 5357: _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.”
line 5358: 
line 5359: “Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added
line 5360: Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
line 5361: 
line 5362: “Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
line 5363: woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
line 5364: 
line 5365: The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
line 5366: and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
line 5367: Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
line 5368: Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
line 5369: and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
line 5370: was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
line 5371: would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
line 5372: interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
line 5373: Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
line 5374: 
line 5375: About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
line 5376: for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
line 5377: confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
line 5378: up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
line 5379: the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
line 5380: agitation, cried out--
line 5381: 
line 5382: “Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
line 5383: there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
line 5384: haste, and come down this moment.”
line 5385: 
line 5386: Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
line 5387: and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
line 5388: quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
line 5389: garden gate.
line 5390: 
line 5391: “And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs
line 5392: were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
line 5393: daughter.”
line 5394: 
line 5395: “La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not
line 5396: Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
line 5397: the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
line 5398: creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”
line 5399: 
line 5400: “She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
line 5401: Why does she not come in?”
line 5402: 
line 5403: “Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
line 5404: when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”
line 5405: 
line 5406: “I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She
line 5407: looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
line 5408: make him a very proper wife.”
line 5409: 
line 5410: Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
line 5411: with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was
line 5412: stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
line 5413: before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
line 5414: way.
line 5415: 
line 5416: At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
line 5417: the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
line 5418: girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
line 5419: Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
line 5420: to dine at Rosings the next day.
line 5421: 
line 5422: 
line 5423: 
line 5424: Chapter 29
line 5425: 
line 5426: 
line 5427: Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
line 5428: The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
line 5429: visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
line 5430: wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
line 5431: of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
line 5432: Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
line 5433: 
line 5434: “I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by
line 5435: her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
line 5436: Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
line 5437: would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
line 5438: could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
line 5439: (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
line 5440: after your arrival!”
line 5441: 
line 5442: “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
line 5443: “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
line 5444: my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
line 5445: instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
line 5446: 
line 5447: Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
line 5448: visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
line 5449: they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
line 5450: so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
line 5451: 
line 5452: When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--
line 5453: 
line 5454: “Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
line 5455: Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
line 5456: becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
line 5457: whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
line 5458: for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
line 5459: for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
line 5460: preserved.”
line 5461: 
line 5462: While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
line 5463: doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
line 5464: objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
line 5465: her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
line 5466: who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
line 5467: introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
line 5468: to his presentation at St. James's.
line 5469: 
line 5470: As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
line 5471: mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
line 5472: Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
line 5473: raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
line 5474: slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
line 5475: house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
line 5476: cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
line 5477: 
line 5478: When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
line 5479: moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
line 5480: Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
line 5481: Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
line 5482: miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
line 5483: she could witness without trepidation.
line 5484: 
line 5485: From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
line 5486: rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
line 5487: followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
line 5488: Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
line 5489: with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
line 5490: settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
line 5491: be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
line 5492: apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
line 5493: 
line 5494: In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely
line 5495: awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
line 5496: enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
line 5497: and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
line 5498: of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
line 5499: quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
line 5500: composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
line 5501: features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
line 5502: conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
line 5503: visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
line 5504: silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
line 5505: as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
line 5506: Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
line 5507: believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
line 5508: 
line 5509: When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
line 5510: she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
line 5511: daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her
line 5512: being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
line 5513: likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
line 5514: features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
line 5515: little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
line 5516: there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
line 5517: to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
line 5518: her eyes.
line 5519: 
line 5520: After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
line 5521: admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
line 5522: and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
line 5523: looking at in the summer.
line 5524: 
line 5525: The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
line 5526: all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
line 5527: likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
line 5528: ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
line 5529: nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
line 5530: alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
line 5531: William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
line 5532: said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
line 5533: But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
line 5534: gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
line 5535: a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
line 5536: was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
line 5537: between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
line 5538: listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
line 5539: dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
line 5540: Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
line 5541: she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
line 5542: gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
line 5543: 
line 5544: When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
line 5545: be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
line 5546: intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
line 5547: subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
line 5548: have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic
line 5549: concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
line 5550: to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
line 5551: regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
line 5552: care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
line 5553: beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
line 5554: occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
line 5555: with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
line 5556: Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
line 5557: the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
line 5558: pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
line 5559: she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
line 5560: them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
line 5561: had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
line 5562: her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
line 5563: her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
line 5564: observed,
line 5565: 
line 5566: “Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
line 5567: sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
line 5568: occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
line 5569: necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss
line 5570: Bennet?”
line 5571: 
line 5572: “A little.”
line 5573: 
line 5574: “Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
line 5575: instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
line 5576: some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”
line 5577: 
line 5578: “One of them does.”
line 5579: 
line 5580: “Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
line 5581: Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
line 5582: you draw?”
line 5583: 
line 5584: “No, not at all.”
line 5585: 
line 5586: “What, none of you?”
line 5587: 
line 5588: “Not one.”
line 5589: 
line 5590: “That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
line 5591: should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
line 5592: 
line 5593: “My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”
line 5594: 
line 5595: “Has your governess left you?”
line 5596: 
line 5597: “We never had any governess.”
line 5598: 
line 5599: “No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
line 5600: without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
line 5601: have been quite a slave to your education.”
line 5602: 
line 5603: Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
line 5604: the case.
line 5605: 
line 5606: “Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
line 5607: must have been neglected.”
line 5608: 
line 5609: “Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
line 5610: wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
line 5611: read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
line 5612: idle, certainly might.”
line 5613: 
line 5614: “Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
line 5615: known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
line 5616: one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
line 5617: and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
line 5618: wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
line 5619: way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
line 5620: of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
line 5621: it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
line 5622: who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
line 5623: delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's
line 5624: calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady
line 5625: Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
line 5626: younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
line 5627: 
line 5628: “Yes, ma'am, all.”
line 5629: 
line 5630: “All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
line 5631: younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
line 5632: must be very young?”
line 5633: 
line 5634: “Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
line 5635: much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
line 5636: younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
line 5637: amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
line 5638: marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
line 5639: as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
line 5640: not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
line 5641: 
line 5642: “Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
line 5643: for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”
line 5644: 
line 5645: “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
line 5646: ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
line 5647: 
line 5648: Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
line 5649: and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
line 5650: dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
line 5651: 
line 5652: “You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
line 5653: conceal your age.”
line 5654: 
line 5655: “I am not one-and-twenty.”
line 5656: 
line 5657: When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
line 5658: were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
line 5659: down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
line 5660: two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
line 5661: party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
line 5662: uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
line 5663: expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
line 5664: having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
line 5665: other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
line 5666: of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
line 5667: was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
line 5668: for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
line 5669: Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
line 5670: and noble names.
line 5671: 
line 5672: When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
line 5673: the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
line 5674: gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
line 5675: round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
line 5676: to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
line 5677: the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
line 5678: Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon
line 5679: as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
line 5680: to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
line 5681: Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
line 5682: commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
line 5683: Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise
line 5684: into his own hands.
line 5685: 
line 5686: 
line 5687: 
line 5688: Chapter 30
line 5689: 
line 5690: 
line 5691: Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
line 5692: enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,
line 5693: and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
line 5694: often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
line 5695: morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
line 5696: when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
line 5697: and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
line 5698: cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
line 5699: and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
line 5700: reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
line 5701: which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
line 5702: Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
line 5703: the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
line 5704: more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
line 5705: reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
line 5706: much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
line 5707: she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
line 5708: 
line 5709: From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
line 5710: were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
line 5711: along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
line 5712: which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
line 5713: almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
line 5714: had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
line 5715: prevailed upon to get out.
line 5716: 
line 5717: Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
line 5718: not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
line 5719: and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
line 5720: to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
line 5721: hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
line 5722: and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
line 5723: these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
line 5724: and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
line 5725: of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
line 5726: accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
line 5727: out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.
line 5728: 
line 5729: Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
line 5730: commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
line 5731: in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
line 5732: by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
line 5733: be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
line 5734: village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
line 5735: them into harmony and plenty.
line 5736: 
line 5737: The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
line 5738: and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
line 5739: card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
line 5740: of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
line 5741: in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,
line 5742: however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
line 5743: comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
line 5744: Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
line 5745: often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
line 5746: frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
line 5747: along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
line 5748: a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
line 5749: where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.
line 5750: 
line 5751: In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
line 5752: Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
line 5753: addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
line 5754: important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
line 5755: expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
line 5756: many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
line 5757: furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
line 5758: she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
line 5759: were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
line 5760: destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
line 5761: satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
line 5762: seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
line 5763: Miss Lucas and herself.
line 5764: 
line 5765: His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
line 5766: the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
line 5767: in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
line 5768: bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
line 5769: intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
line 5770: respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
line 5771: Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
line 5772: his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
line 5773: Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
line 5774: them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
line 5775: into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:
line 5776: 
line 5777: “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
line 5778: never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
line 5779: 
line 5780: Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
line 5781: before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
line 5782: afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
line 5783: who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
line 5784: address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
line 5785: used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
line 5786: reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
line 5787: friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
line 5788: curtseyed to him without saying a word.
line 5789: 
line 5790: Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
line 5791: readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
line 5792: his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
line 5793: garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
line 5794: At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
line 5795: Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
line 5796: way, and after a moment's pause, added:
line 5797: 
line 5798: “My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
line 5799: happened to see her there?”
line 5800: 
line 5801: She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
line 5802: whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
line 5803: the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
line 5804: answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
line 5805: subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
line 5806: away.
line 5807: 
line 5808: 
line 5809: 
line 5810: Chapter 31
line 5811: 
line 5812: 
line 5813: Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
line 5814: and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
line 5815: of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
line 5816: received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
line 5817: house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
line 5818: almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
line 5819: such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
line 5820: come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
line 5821: of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
line 5822: Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
line 5823: only at church.
line 5824: 
line 5825: The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
line 5826: the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received
line 5827: them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
line 5828: acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
line 5829: almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
line 5830: much more than to any other person in the room.
line 5831: 
line 5832: Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
line 5833: welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
line 5834: moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
line 5835: talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
line 5836: at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
line 5837: well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
line 5838: spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
line 5839: as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
line 5840: towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
line 5841: while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
line 5842: scruple to call out:
line 5843: 
line 5844: “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
line 5845: of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
line 5846: 
line 5847: “We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
line 5848: a reply.
line 5849: 
line 5850: “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
line 5851: must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
line 5852: There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
line 5853: of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
line 5854: I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
line 5855: had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
line 5856: delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”
line 5857: 
line 5858: Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.
line 5859: 
line 5860: “I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady
line 5861: Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
line 5862: if she does not practice a good deal.”
line 5863: 
line 5864: “I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
line 5865: She practises very constantly.”
line 5866: 
line 5867: “So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
line 5868: to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
line 5869: tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
line 5870: constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
line 5871: will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
line 5872: Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
line 5873: her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
line 5874: Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part
line 5875: of the house.”
line 5876: 
line 5877: Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made
line 5878: no answer.
line 5879: 
line 5880: When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
line 5881: promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
line 5882: drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
line 5883: talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
line 5884: from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
line 5885: stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
line 5886: countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
line 5887: convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:
line 5888: 
line 5889: “You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
line 5890: me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
line 5891: is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
line 5892: will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
line 5893: me.”
line 5894: 
line 5895: “I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not
line 5896: really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
line 5897: had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
line 5898: great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
line 5899: not your own.”
line 5900: 
line 5901: Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
line 5902: Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
line 5903: me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
line 5904: in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
line 5905: of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
line 5906: credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
line 5907: that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
line 5908: say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
line 5909: things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”
line 5910: 
line 5911: “I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
line 5912: 
line 5913: “Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
line 5914: Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”
line 5915: 
line 5916: “You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
line 5917: The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
line 5918: was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
line 5919: only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
line 5920: knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
line 5921: partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”
line 5922: 
line 5923: “I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
line 5924: beyond my own party.”
line 5925: 
line 5926: “True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
line 5927: Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”
line 5928: 
line 5929: “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an
line 5930: introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
line 5931: 
line 5932: “Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
line 5933: addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
line 5934: education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
line 5935: himself to strangers?”
line 5936: 
line 5937: “I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to
line 5938: him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”
line 5939: 
line 5940: “I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
line 5941: “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
line 5942: catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
line 5943: concerns, as I often see done.”
line 5944: 
line 5945: “My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
line 5946: masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same
line 5947: force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
line 5948: have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
line 5949: trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
line 5950: capable as any other woman's of superior execution.”
line 5951: 
line 5952: Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your
line 5953: time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
line 5954: think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”
line 5955: 
line 5956: Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
line 5957: what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
line 5958: Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
line 5959: to Darcy:
line 5960: 
line 5961: “Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
line 5962: could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
line 5963: of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have
line 5964: been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
line 5965: 
line 5966: Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
line 5967: cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
line 5968: discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
line 5969: de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
line 5970: been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
line 5971: 
line 5972: Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
line 5973: with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
line 5974: them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
line 5975: gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
line 5976: ready to take them all home.
line 5977: 
line 5978: 
line 5979: 
line 5980: Chapter 32
line 5981: 
line 5982: 
line 5983: Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
line 5984: while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
line 5985: when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
line 5986: visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
line 5987: be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
line 5988: half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
line 5989: when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
line 5990: Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.
line 5991: 
line 5992: He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
line 5993: intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
line 5994: to be within.
line 5995: 
line 5996: They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
line 5997: seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
line 5998: necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
line 5999: recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
line 6000: feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
line 6001: departure, she observed:
line 6002: 
line 6003: “How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
line 6004: It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
line 6005: all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
line 6006: before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”
line 6007: 
line 6008: “Perfectly so, I thank you.”
line 6009: 
line 6010: She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
line 6011: pause added:
line 6012: 
line 6013: “I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
line 6014: returning to Netherfield again?”
line 6015: 
line 6016: “I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
line 6017: very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
line 6018: is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
line 6019: increasing.”
line 6020: 
line 6021: “If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
line 6022: the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
line 6023: might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
line 6024: not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
line 6025: for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
line 6026: principle.”
line 6027: 
line 6028: “I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
line 6029: soon as any eligible purchase offers.”
line 6030: 
line 6031: Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
line 6032: friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
line 6033: trouble of finding a subject to him.
line 6034: 
line 6035: He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
line 6036: house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
line 6037: Collins first came to Hunsford.”
line 6038: 
line 6039: “I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
line 6040: kindness on a more grateful object.”
line 6041: 
line 6042: “Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”
line 6043: 
line 6044: “Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
line 6045: of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
line 6046: him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
line 6047: I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
line 6048: wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
line 6049: prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”
line 6050: 
line 6051: “It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
line 6052: distance of her own family and friends.”
line 6053: 
line 6054: “An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”
line 6055: 
line 6056: “And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
line 6057: journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.”
line 6058: 
line 6059: “I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
line 6060: of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins
line 6061: was settled _near_ her family.”
line 6062: 
line 6063: “It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
line 6064: the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”
line 6065: 
line 6066: As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
line 6067: understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
line 6068: Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:
line 6069: 
line 6070: “I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
line 6071: family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
line 6072: varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
line 6073: travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
line 6074: case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
line 6075: such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
line 6076: friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
line 6077: the present distance.”
line 6078: 
line 6079: Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot
line 6080: have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
line 6081: been always at Longbourn.”
line 6082: 
line 6083: Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
line 6084: feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
line 6085: glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:
line 6086: 
line 6087: “Are you pleased with Kent?”
line 6088: 
line 6089: A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
line 6090: calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
line 6091: and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
line 6092: them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
line 6093: on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
line 6094: much to anybody, went away.
line 6095: 
line 6096: “What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
line 6097: gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
line 6098: have called us in this familiar way.”
line 6099: 
line 6100: But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
line 6101: even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
line 6102: conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
line 6103: the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
line 6104: from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
line 6105: was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
line 6106: always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
line 6107: pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
line 6108: two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
line 6109: almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
line 6110: separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
line 6111: aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
line 6112: had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
line 6113: him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
line 6114: being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
line 6115: former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
line 6116: there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
line 6117: she believed he might have the best informed mind.
line 6118: 
line 6119: But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
line 6120: to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
line 6121: ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
line 6122: it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
line 6123: to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
line 6124: animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
line 6125: Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
line 6126: generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
line 6127: her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
line 6128: of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
line 6129: seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
line 6130: Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
line 6131: certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
line 6132: look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
line 6133: doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
line 6134: seemed nothing but absence of mind.
line 6135: 
line 6136: She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
line 6137: being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
line 6138: Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
line 6139: raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
line 6140: opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
line 6141: vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
line 6142: 
line 6143: 
line 6144: In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
line 6145: Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
line 6146: certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
line 6147: to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
line 6148: in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.
line 6149: 
line 6150: 
line 6151: 
line 6152: Chapter 33
line 6153: 
line 6154: 
line 6155: More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
line 6156: unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
line 6157: mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
line 6158: prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
line 6159: it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
line 6160: therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
line 6161: wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
line 6162: not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
line 6163: but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
line 6164: never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
line 6165: or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
line 6166: rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
line 6167: her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
line 6168: opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of
line 6169: Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
line 6170: expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
line 6171: _there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
line 6172: Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
line 6173: mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
line 6174: her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
line 6175: pales opposite the Parsonage.
line 6176: 
line 6177: She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,
line 6178: and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
line 6179: spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
line 6180: on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
line 6181: letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:
line 6182: 
line 6183: “I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
line 6184: 
line 6185: “I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally
line 6186: do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
line 6187: you going much farther?”
line 6188: 
line 6189: “No, I should have turned in a moment.”
line 6190: 
line 6191: And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
line 6192: together.
line 6193: 
line 6194: “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
line 6195: 
line 6196: “Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
line 6197: arranges the business just as he pleases.”
line 6198: 
line 6199: “And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
line 6200: pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
line 6201: more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”
line 6202: 
line 6203: “He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
line 6204: “But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
line 6205: than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
line 6206: feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
line 6207: dependence.”
line 6208: 
line 6209: “In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
line 6210: either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
line 6211: dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
line 6212: wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”
line 6213: 
line 6214: “These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
line 6215: experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
line 6216: weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
line 6217: they like.”
line 6218: 
line 6219: “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
line 6220: do.”
line 6221: 
line 6222: “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
line 6223: in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
line 6224: money.”
line 6225: 
line 6226: “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
line 6227: idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what
line 6228: is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is
line 6229: very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
line 6230: 
line 6231: He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
line 6232: a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
line 6233: she soon afterwards said:
line 6234: 
line 6235: “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
line 6236: having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
line 6237: lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
line 6238: for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
line 6239: likes with her.”
line 6240: 
line 6241: “No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must
line 6242: divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”
line 6243: 
line 6244: “Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
line 6245: charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
line 6246: little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
line 6247: may like to have her own way.”
line 6248: 
line 6249: As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
line 6250: in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
line 6251: give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
line 6252: got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:
line 6253: 
line 6254: “You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
line 6255: say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
line 6256: very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
line 6257: Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”
line 6258: 
line 6259: “I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
line 6260: is a great friend of Darcy's.”
line 6261: 
line 6262: “Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
line 6263: Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”
line 6264: 
line 6265: “Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
line 6266: those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
line 6267: our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
line 6268: him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
line 6269: Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”
line 6270: 
line 6271: “What is it you mean?”
line 6272: 
line 6273: “It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
line 6274: because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an
line 6275: unpleasant thing.”
line 6276: 
line 6277: “You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
line 6278: 
line 6279: “And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
line 6280: Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
line 6281: on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
line 6282: imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
line 6283: particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
line 6284: him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
line 6285: knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
line 6286: 
line 6287: “Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”
line 6288: 
line 6289: “I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
line 6290: lady.”
line 6291: 
line 6292: “And what arts did he use to separate them?”
line 6293: 
line 6294: “He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He
line 6295: only told me what I have now told you.”
line 6296: 
line 6297: Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
line 6298: indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
line 6299: was so thoughtful.
line 6300: 
line 6301: “I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your
line 6302: cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”
line 6303: 
line 6304: “You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
line 6305: 
line 6306: “I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
line 6307: friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
line 6308: determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
line 6309: But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
line 6310: particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
line 6311: that there was much affection in the case.”
line 6312: 
line 6313: “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a
line 6314: lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.”
line 6315: 
line 6316: This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
line 6317: of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
line 6318: therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
line 6319: matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
line 6320: as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
line 6321: of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
line 6322: people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
line 6323: could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
line 6324: such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
line 6325: taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
line 6326: always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
line 6327: of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
line 6328: the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
line 6329: suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
line 6330: every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
line 6331: world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
line 6332: 
line 6333: “There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
line 6334: Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her
line 6335: having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
line 6336: business in London.
line 6337: 
line 6338: “To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
line 6339: objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
line 6340: excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
line 6341: could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
line 6342: peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
line 6343: respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of
line 6344: her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
line 6345: that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
line 6346: pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
line 6347: importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;
line 6348: and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
line 6349: by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
line 6350: Bingley for his sister.
line 6351: 
line 6352: The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
line 6353: headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
line 6354: her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
line 6355: cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
line 6356: seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
line 6357: as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
line 6358: could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
line 6359: displeased by her staying at home.
line 6360: 
line 6361: 
line 6362: 
line 6363: Chapter 34
line 6364: 
line 6365: 
line 6366: When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
line 6367: as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
line 6368: examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
line 6369: being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
line 6370: revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
line 6371: But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
line 6372: cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
line 6373: proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
line 6374: disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
line 6375: noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
line 6376: attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
line 6377: shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
line 6378: a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation
line 6379: to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
line 6380: next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
line 6381: herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
line 6382: her spirits, by all that affection could do.
line 6383: 
line 6384: She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that
line 6385: his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
line 6386: that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
line 6387: mean to be unhappy about him.
line 6388: 
line 6389: While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
line 6390: door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
line 6391: being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
line 6392: the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
line 6393: But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
line 6394: affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
line 6395: room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
line 6396: health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
line 6397: She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
line 6398: then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
line 6399: said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
line 6400: in an agitated manner, and thus began:
line 6401: 
line 6402: “In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
line 6403: repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
line 6404: you.”
line 6405: 
line 6406: Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
line 6407: doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
line 6408: and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
line 6409: immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
line 6410: those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
line 6411: subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
line 6412: its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
line 6413: opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
line 6414: the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
line 6415: suit.
line 6416: 
line 6417: In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
line 6418: the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
line 6419: not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
line 6420: receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
line 6421: lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
line 6422: answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
line 6423: representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
line 6424: of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
line 6425: expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
line 6426: his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
line 6427: of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
line 6428: his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
line 6429: only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
line 6430: cheeks, and she said:
line 6431: 
line 6432: “In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
line 6433: express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
line 6434: unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
line 6435: be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
line 6436: cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
line 6437: bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
line 6438: anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
line 6439: of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
line 6440: the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
line 6441: overcoming it after this explanation.”
line 6442: 
line 6443: Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
line 6444: on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
line 6445: surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
line 6446: of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
line 6447: appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
line 6448: himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
line 6449: dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:
line 6450: 
line 6451: “And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
line 6452: I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
line 6453: civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
line 6454: 
line 6455: “I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire
line 6456: of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
line 6457: against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
line 6458: Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
line 6459: other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
line 6460: you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
line 6461: think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
line 6462: been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
line 6463: beloved sister?”
line 6464: 
line 6465: As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
line 6466: was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
line 6467: continued:
line 6468: 
line 6469: “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
line 6470: excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
line 6471: you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
line 6472: of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
line 6473: world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
line 6474: disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
line 6475: kind.”
line 6476: 
line 6477: She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
line 6478: with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
line 6479: He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
line 6480: 
line 6481: “Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
line 6482: 
line 6483: With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying
line 6484: that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
line 6485: sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
line 6486: kinder than towards myself.”
line 6487: 
line 6488: Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
line 6489: but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
line 6490: 
line 6491: “But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
line 6492: is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
line 6493: decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
line 6494: many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
line 6495: say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
line 6496: or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
line 6497: 
line 6498: “You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said Darcy,
line 6499: in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
line 6500: 
line 6501: “Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
line 6502: interest in him?”
line 6503: 
line 6504: “His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes
line 6505: have been great indeed.”
line 6506: 
line 6507: “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced
line 6508: him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
line 6509: withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
line 6510: him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
line 6511: which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
line 6512: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
line 6513: ridicule.”
line 6514: 
line 6515: “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
line 6516: “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
line 6517: I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
line 6518: calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in
line 6519: his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been
line 6520: overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
line 6521: scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
line 6522: bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
line 6523: policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
line 6524: my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
line 6525: reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
line 6526: Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
line 6527: just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
line 6528: connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
line 6529: condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
line 6530: 
line 6531: Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
line 6532: the utmost to speak with composure when she said:
line 6533: 
line 6534: “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
line 6535: declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
line 6536: which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
line 6537: gentlemanlike manner.”
line 6538: 
line 6539: She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
line 6540: 
line 6541: “You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
line 6542: would have tempted me to accept it.”
line 6543: 
line 6544: Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
line 6545: expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
line 6546: 
line 6547: “From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
line 6548: my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
line 6549: belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
line 6550: the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
line 6551: disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
line 6552: dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
line 6553: last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
line 6554: 
line 6555: “You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
line 6556: feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
line 6557: Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
line 6558: wishes for your health and happiness.”
line 6559: 
line 6560: And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
line 6561: the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
line 6562: 
line 6563: The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
line 6564: to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
line 6565: half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
line 6566: was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
line 6567: marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
line 6568: so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
line 6569: all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying
line 6570: her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
line 6571: own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
line 6572: unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
line 6573: pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
line 6574: Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
line 6575: not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
line 6576: Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
line 6577: overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
line 6578: a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
line 6579: sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
line 6580: encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.
line 6581: 
line 6582: 
line 6583: 
line 6584: Chapter 35
line 6585: 
line 6586: 
line 6587: Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
line 6588: which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
line 6589: surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
line 6590: else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
line 6591: breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
line 6592: directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
line 6593: sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
line 6594: she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
line 6595: park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
line 6596: of the gates into the ground.
line 6597: 
line 6598: After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
line 6599: tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
line 6600: look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
line 6601: made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
line 6602: verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
line 6603: when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
line 6604: edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
line 6605: Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
line 6606: near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
line 6607: her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
line 6608: in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
line 6609: gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
line 6610: which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
line 6611: “I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
line 6612: Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a
line 6613: slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
line 6614: 
line 6615: With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
line 6616: Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
line 6617: perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
line 6618: quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
line 6619: full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
line 6620: from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
line 6621: 
line 6622: “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
line 6623: of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
line 6624: offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
line 6625: intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
line 6626: which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
line 6627: effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
line 6628: should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
line 6629: and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
line 6630: your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
line 6631: demand it of your justice.
line 6632: 
line 6633: “Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
line 6634: magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
line 6635: that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
line 6636: from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
line 6637: claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
line 6638: prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
line 6639: wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
line 6640: favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
line 6641: dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
line 6642: its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
line 6643: persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
line 6644: bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
line 6645: night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
line 6646: to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
line 6647: and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
line 6648: is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
line 6649: may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
line 6650: must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
line 6651: 
line 6652: “I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
line 6653: others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
line 6654: woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
line 6655: at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
line 6656: attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
line 6657: had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
line 6658: William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to
line 6659: your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
line 6660: He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
line 6661: be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour
line 6662: attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
line 6663: Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
line 6664: watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
line 6665: but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
line 6666: from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
line 6667: with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
line 6668: sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
line 6669: in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
line 6670: probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
line 6671: pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
line 6672: scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and
line 6673: air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
line 6674: that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
line 6675: easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
line 6676: certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
line 6677: are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
line 6678: her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
line 6679: conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
line 6680: marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
line 6681: the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
line 6682: connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
line 6683: there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
line 6684: existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
line 6685: myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
line 6686: me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
line 6687: mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
line 6688: total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
line 6689: herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
line 6690: father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
line 6691: for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
line 6692: representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
line 6693: have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
line 6694: is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
line 6695: it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
line 6696: farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
line 6697: was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
line 6698: me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
line 6699: connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
line 6700: you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
line 6701: 
line 6702: “The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness
line 6703: had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
line 6704: soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
line 6705: detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
line 6706: London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
line 6707: of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
line 6708: described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
line 6709: might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
line 6710: that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
line 6711: seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
line 6712: sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his
line 6713: affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
line 6714: natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
line 6715: own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
line 6716: no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
line 6717: Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
line 6718: work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
line 6719: is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
line 6720: reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
line 6721: measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in
line 6722: town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
line 6723: brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
line 6724: ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
line 6725: enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
line 6726: concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
line 6727: was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
line 6728: other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
line 6729: was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
line 6730: you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
line 6731: them.
line 6732: 
line 6733: “With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
line 6734: Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
line 6735: connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
line 6736: am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
line 6737: than one witness of undoubted veracity.
line 6738: 
line 6739: “Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
line 6740: years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
line 6741: conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
line 6742: be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
line 6743: kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
line 6744: school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
line 6745: own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
line 6746: been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only
line 6747: fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he
line 6748: had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
line 6749: his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
line 6750: many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
line 6751: manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
line 6752: careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
line 6753: the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
line 6754: and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
line 6755: Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
line 6756: you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
line 6757: has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
line 6758: unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.
line 6759: 
line 6760: “My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
line 6761: Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
line 6762: recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
line 6763: that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
line 6764: valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
line 6765: was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
line 6766: survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
line 6767: wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
line 6768: he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
line 6769: immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
line 6770: could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
line 6771: law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
line 6772: be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
line 6773: him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
line 6774: his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
line 6775: business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
line 6776: in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
line 6777: receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
line 6778: between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
line 6779: to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
line 6780: lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
line 6781: from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
line 6782: For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
line 6783: incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
line 6784: me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
line 6785: me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
line 6786: had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
line 6787: resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
line 6788: question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
line 6789: well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
line 6790: have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame
line 6791: me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
line 6792: repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
line 6793: his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
line 6794: to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
line 6795: appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
line 6796: last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
line 6797: 
line 6798: “I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
line 6799: and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
line 6800: to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
line 6801: secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
line 6802: the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
line 6803: About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
line 6804: for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
line 6805: over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
line 6806: design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
line 6807: and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
line 6808: by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
line 6809: whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
line 6810: her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
line 6811: to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
line 6812: excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
line 6813: the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
line 6814: before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
line 6815: idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
line 6816: a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
line 6817: how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented
line 6818: any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
line 6819: immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
line 6820: Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which
line 6821: is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
line 6822: revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
line 6823: been complete indeed.
line 6824: 
line 6825: “This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
line 6826: been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
line 6827: false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
line 6828: Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
line 6829: had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
line 6830: at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
line 6831: detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
line 6832: your inclination.
line 6833: 
line 6834: “You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
line 6835: I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
line 6836: be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
line 6837: particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
line 6838: near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
line 6839: the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
line 6840: with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
line 6841: should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
line 6842: the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
line 6843: the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
line 6844: opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
line 6845: morning. I will only add, God bless you.

line 6847: “FITZWILLIAM DARCY”
line 6848: 
line 6849: 
line 6850: 
line 6851: Chapter 36
line 6852: 
line 6853: 
line 6854: If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
line 6855: contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
line 6856: its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
line 6857: she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
line 6858: Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
line 6859: she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
line 6860: and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
line 6861: to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
line 6862: prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
line 6863: had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
line 6864: left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
line 6865: next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
line 6866: the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she
line 6867: instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
line 6868: objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
line 6869: him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
line 6870: her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
line 6871: insolence.
line 6872: 
line 6873: But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
line 6874: she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
line 6875: if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
line 6876: bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
line 6877: feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
line 6878: Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
line 6879: to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!
line 6880: This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
line 6881: gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
line 6882: last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
line 6883: regard it, that she would never look in it again.
line 6884: 
line 6885: In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
line 6886: nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
line 6887: was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
line 6888: again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
line 6889: commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
line 6890: The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
line 6891: he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
line 6892: she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
line 6893: words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
line 6894: will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
line 6895: was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
line 6896: impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
line 6897: other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
line 6898: not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
line 6899: particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
line 6900: to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
line 6901: thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
line 6902: the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
line 6903: impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
line 6904: little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
line 6905: on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
line 6906: believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
line 6907: render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
line 6908: turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
line 6909: 
line 6910: The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
line 6911: Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
line 6912: bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
line 6913: entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
line 6914: persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
line 6915: had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
line 6916: nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
line 6917: to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
line 6918: never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
line 6919: established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
line 6920: to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
line 6921: integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
line 6922: Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
line 6923: casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
line 6924: had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But
line 6925: no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
line 6926: her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
line 6927: substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
line 6928: the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
line 6929: pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
line 6930: read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
line 6931: Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
line 6932: Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
line 6933: referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
line 6934: himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
line 6935: near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
line 6936: reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
line 6937: him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
line 6938: at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
line 6939: have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
line 6940: cousin's corroboration.
line 6941: 
line 6942: She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
line 6943: between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.
line 6944: Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
line 6945: struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
line 6946: wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
line 6947: himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
line 6948: with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
line 6949: of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
line 6950: _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
line 6951: the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
line 6952: family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
line 6953: herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
line 6954: that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's
line 6955: character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
line 6956: always prevent his exposing the son.
line 6957: 
line 6958: How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
line 6959: His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
line 6960: hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
line 6961: the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
line 6962: His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
line 6963: either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
line 6964: his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
line 6965: incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
line 6966: and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
line 6967: but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
line 6968: asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
line 6969: were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
line 6970: acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
line 6971: together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
line 6972: that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
line 6973: of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
line 6974: esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
line 6975: brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
line 6976: sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
line 6977: actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
line 6978: everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
line 6979: that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
line 6980: as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
line 6981: 
line 6982: She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
line 6983: could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
line 6984: absurd.
line 6985: 
line 6986: “How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself
line 6987: on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
line 6988: often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
line 6989: my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
line 6990: discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
line 6991: not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
line 6992: folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
line 6993: of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
line 6994: prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
line 6995: concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”
line 6996: 
line 6997: From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
line 6998: which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
line 6999: _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
line 7000: different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
line 7001: credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
line 7002: give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
line 7003: sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's
line 7004: opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
line 7005: description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were
line 7006: little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
line 7007: and manner not often united with great sensibility.
line 7008: 
line 7009: When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
line 7010: mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
line 7011: of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
line 7012: for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
line 7013: having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
line 7014: disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
line 7015: than on hers.
line 7016: 
line 7017: The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
line 7018: but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
line 7019: self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
line 7020: that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
line 7021: relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
line 7022: by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
line 7023: had ever known before.
line 7024: 
line 7025: After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
line 7026: variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
line 7027: and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
line 7028: so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
line 7029: her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
line 7030: of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
line 7031: reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
line 7032: 
line 7033: She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
line 7034: called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
line 7035: leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
line 7036: an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
line 7037: till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
line 7038: in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
line 7039: longer an object; she could think only of her letter.
line 7040: 
line 7041: 
line 7042: 
line 7043: Chapter 37
line 7044: 
line 7045: 
line 7046: The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
line 7047: been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
line 7048: able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
line 7049: good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
line 7050: melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
line 7051: hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
line 7052: brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
line 7053: importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
line 7054: having them all to dine with her.
line 7055: 
line 7056: Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
line 7057: she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
line 7058: her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
line 7059: ladyship's indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how
line 7060: would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.
line 7061: 
line 7062: Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure
line 7063: you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one
line 7064: feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
line 7065: attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
line 7066: me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
line 7067: dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
line 7068: seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
line 7069: attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”
line 7070: 
line 7071: Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
line 7072: were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
line 7073: 
line 7074: Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
line 7075: spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
line 7076: she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:
line 7077: 
line 7078: “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
line 7079: you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
line 7080: company, I am sure.”
line 7081: 
line 7082: “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
line 7083: Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
line 7084: next Saturday.”
line 7085: 
line 7086: “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
line 7087: you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
line 7088: can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
line 7089: spare you for another fortnight.”
line 7090: 
line 7091: “But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
line 7092: 
line 7093: “Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
line 7094: are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
line 7095: another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
line 7096: far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
line 7097: Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
line 7098: for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
line 7099: should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”
line 7100: 
line 7101: “You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
line 7102: original plan.”
line 7103: 
line 7104: Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
line 7105: with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
line 7106: of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
line 7107: You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
line 7108: the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
line 7109: guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
line 7110: niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
line 7111: having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
line 7112: Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
line 7113: propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
line 7114: things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
line 7115: am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
line 7116: discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
line 7117: 
line 7118: “My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
line 7119: 
line 7120: “Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
line 7121: have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
line 7122: Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
line 7123: attended to.”
line 7124: 
line 7125: Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
line 7126: and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
line 7127: which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
line 7128: occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
line 7129: reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
line 7130: as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
line 7131: walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
line 7132: recollections.
line 7133: 
line 7134: Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
line 7135: studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
line 7136: times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
line 7137: she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
line 7138: she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
line 7139: herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
line 7140: His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
line 7141: could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
line 7142: or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
line 7143: behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
line 7144: the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
line 7145: They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
line 7146: them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
line 7147: youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
line 7148: herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
line 7149: united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
line 7150: and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
line 7151: what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
line 7152: irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
line 7153: affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
line 7154: scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
line 7155: there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
line 7156: Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
line 7157: forever.
line 7158: 
line 7159: Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's
line 7160: explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
line 7161: heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
line 7162: to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
line 7163: could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
line 7164: grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
line 7165: respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
line 7166: been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
line 7167: 
line 7168: When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's
line 7169: character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
line 7170: seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
line 7171: almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
line 7172: 
line 7173: Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
line 7174: her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
line 7175: there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
line 7176: their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
line 7177: and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
line 7178: way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
line 7179: work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
line 7180: 
line 7181: When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
line 7182: a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
line 7183: and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
line 7184: hand to both.
line 7185: 
line 7186: 
line 7187: 
line 7188: Chapter 38
line 7189: 
line 7190: 
line 7191: On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
line 7192: minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
line 7193: paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
line 7194: 
line 7195: “I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet
line 7196: expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
line 7197: certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
line 7198: it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
line 7199: know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
line 7200: manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
line 7201: see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
line 7202: yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
line 7203: and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
line 7204: your time unpleasantly.”
line 7205: 
line 7206: Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
line 7207: had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
line 7208: Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
line 7209: feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
line 7210: solemnity replied:
line 7211: 
line 7212: “It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
line 7213: disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
line 7214: having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
line 7215: from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
line 7216: humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
line 7217: visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
line 7218: Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
line 7219: and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
line 7220: see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
line 7221: that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
line 7222: not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
line 7223: sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
line 7224: 
line 7225: Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
line 7226: obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
line 7227: and truth in a few short sentences.
line 7228: 
line 7229: “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
line 7230: Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
line 7231: be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
line 7232: have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
line 7233: that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
line 7234: as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
line 7235: that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
line 7236: marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
line 7237: thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
line 7238: character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
line 7239: other.”
line 7240: 
line 7241: Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
line 7242: the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
line 7243: and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
line 7244: have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
line 7245: Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
line 7246: had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
line 7247: her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
line 7248: home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
line 7249: dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
line 7250: 
line 7251: At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
line 7252: placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
line 7253: parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
line 7254: Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
line 7255: with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
line 7256: for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
line 7257: compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
line 7258: in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
line 7259: when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
line 7260: hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
line 7261: 
line 7262: “But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
line 7263: delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
line 7264: while you have been here.”
line 7265: 
line 7266: Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
line 7267: the carriage drove off.
line 7268: 
line 7269: “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, “it seems
line 7270: but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
line 7271: happened!”
line 7272: 
line 7273: “A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.
line 7274: 
line 7275: “We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
line 7276: How much I shall have to tell!”
line 7277: 
line 7278: Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
line 7279: 
line 7280: Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
line 7281: within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's
line 7282: house, where they were to remain a few days.
line 7283: 
line 7284: Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
line 7285: spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
line 7286: aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
line 7287: Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
line 7288: 
line 7289: It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
line 7290: Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
line 7291: that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
line 7292: Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
line 7293: vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
line 7294: to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
line 7295: in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
line 7296: and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
line 7297: into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
line 7298: further.
line 7299: 
line 7300: 
line 7301: 
line 7302: Chapter 39
line 7303: 
line 7304: 
line 7305: It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
line 7306: together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
line 7307: and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage
line 7308: was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
line 7309: punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
line 7310: These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
line 7311: in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
line 7312: dressing a salad and cucumber.
line 7313: 
line 7314: After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
line 7315: out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
line 7316: “Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”
line 7317: 
line 7318: “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the
line 7319: money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing
line 7320: her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
line 7321: it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
line 7322: pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
line 7323: better.”
line 7324: 
line 7325: And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
line 7326: unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
line 7327: when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
line 7328: think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
line 7329: one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
line 7330: are going in a fortnight.”
line 7331: 
line 7332: “Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
line 7333: 
line 7334: “They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
line 7335: take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
line 7336: and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
line 7337: go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
line 7338: have!”
line 7339: 
line 7340: “Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
line 7341: and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
line 7342: campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
line 7343: regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
line 7344: 
line 7345: “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at
line 7346: table. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
line 7347: a certain person we all like!”
line 7348: 
line 7349: Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
line 7350: not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
line 7351: 
line 7352: “Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
line 7353: waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
line 7354: things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
line 7355: he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
line 7356: my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
line 7357: There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She
line 7358: is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”
line 7359: 
line 7360: “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
line 7361: imprudent as to fortune.”
line 7362: 
line 7363: “She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
line 7364: 
line 7365: “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
line 7366: 
line 7367: “I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
line 7368: three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
line 7369: thing?”
line 7370: 
line 7371: Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
line 7372: coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
line 7373: was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
line 7374: 
line 7375: As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
line 7376: ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
line 7377: boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
line 7378: Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.
line 7379: 
line 7380: “How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my
line 7381: bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
line 7382: let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
line 7383: home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
line 7384: since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
line 7385: flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
line 7386: before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
line 7387: She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
line 7388: being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
line 7389: get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
line 7390: Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
line 7391: how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
line 7392: chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
line 7393: of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend
line 7394: the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
line 7395: evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
line 7396: she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
line 7397: was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
line 7398: dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
line 7399: lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
line 7400: Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
line 7401: one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
line 7402: and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
line 7403: did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
line 7404: Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
line 7405: something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
line 7406: 
line 7407: With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
line 7408: Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
line 7409: companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
line 7410: could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.
line 7411: 
line 7412: Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
line 7413: in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
line 7414: say voluntarily to Elizabeth:
line 7415: 
line 7416: “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
line 7417: 
line 7418: Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
line 7419: came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
line 7420: occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
line 7421: poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
line 7422: hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
line 7423: some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
line 7424: Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,
line 7425: was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
line 7426: would hear her.
line 7427: 
line 7428: “Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
line 7429: As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
line 7430: was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
line 7431: had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
line 7432: very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
line 7433: luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
line 7434: you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
line 7435: should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
line 7436: we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
line 7437: anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
line 7438: 
line 7439: To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,
line 7440: to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
line 7441: generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
line 7442: _me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”
line 7443: 
line 7444: But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
line 7445: anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
line 7446: 
line 7447: In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
line 7448: to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
line 7449: opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
line 7450: not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
line 7451: There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
line 7452: Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
line 7453: comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
line 7454: expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
line 7455: there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
line 7456: 
line 7457: She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
line 7458: scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
line 7459: frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
line 7460: father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
line 7461: at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
line 7462: disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
line 7463: 
line 7464: 
line 7465: 
line 7466: Chapter 40
line 7467: 
line 7468: 
line 7469: Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
line 7470: no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
line 7471: particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
line 7472: surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
line 7473: between Mr. Darcy and herself.
line 7474: 
line 7475: Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
line 7476: partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
line 7477: natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
line 7478: sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
line 7479: little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
line 7480: unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.
line 7481: 
line 7482: “His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
line 7483: ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
line 7484: disappointment!”
line 7485: 
line 7486: “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
line 7487: other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
line 7488: You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
line 7489: 
line 7490: “Blame you! Oh, no.”
line 7491: 
line 7492: “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
line 7493: 
line 7494: “No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
line 7495: 
line 7496: “But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
line 7497: day.”
line 7498: 
line 7499: She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
line 7500: as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
line 7501: who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
line 7502: so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
line 7503: collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
line 7504: grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
line 7505: Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
line 7506: seek to clear the one without involving the other.
line 7507: 
line 7508: “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
line 7509: of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
line 7510: with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
line 7511: enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
line 7512: about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;
line 7513: but you shall do as you choose.”
line 7514: 
line 7515: It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
line 7516: 
line 7517: “I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so
line 7518: very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
line 7519: consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
line 7520: knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
line 7521: of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
line 7522: so.”
line 7523: 
line 7524: “Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
line 7525: full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
line 7526: growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
line 7527: makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
line 7528: be as light as a feather.”
line 7529: 
line 7530: “Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
line 7531: countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”
line 7532: 
line 7533: “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
line 7534: two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
line 7535: appearance of it.”
line 7536: 
line 7537: “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
line 7538: used to do.”
line 7539: 
line 7540: “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
line 7541: to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
line 7542: opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
line 7543: abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
line 7544: at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
line 7545: 
line 7546: “Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
line 7547: the matter as you do now.”
line 7548: 
line 7549: “Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
line 7550: with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
line 7551: that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
line 7552: had! Oh! how I wanted you!”
line 7553: 
line 7554: “How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
line 7555: in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
line 7556: undeserved.”
line 7557: 
line 7558: “Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
line 7559: natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
line 7560: is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
line 7561: ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
line 7562: Wickham's character.”
line 7563: 
line 7564: Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no
line 7565: occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”
line 7566: 
line 7567: “That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
line 7568: to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
line 7569: relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
line 7570: myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
line 7571: conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
line 7572: is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
line 7573: Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
line 7574: to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
line 7575: anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
line 7576: and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
line 7577: present I will say nothing about it.”
line 7578: 
line 7579: “You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
line 7580: ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
line 7581: re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”
line 7582: 
line 7583: The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
line 7584: got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
line 7585: and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
line 7586: to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
line 7587: of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
line 7588: half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
line 7589: had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
line 7590: could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
line 7591: understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
line 7592: this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very
line 7593: improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
line 7594: tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
line 7595: liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”
line 7596: 
line 7597: She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
line 7598: state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
line 7599: very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
line 7600: in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
line 7601: and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
line 7602: attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
line 7603: and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
line 7604: attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
line 7605: indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
line 7606: health and their tranquillity.
line 7607: 
line 7608: “Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
line 7609: this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak
line 7610: of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
line 7611: I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
line 7612: a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least
line 7613: chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
line 7614: his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
line 7615: everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
line 7616: 
line 7617: “I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”
line 7618: 
line 7619: “Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
line 7620: shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
line 7621: would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
line 7622: die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”
line 7623: 
line 7624: But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
line 7625: she made no answer.
line 7626: 
line 7627: “Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
line 7628: Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
line 7629: it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
line 7630: excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
line 7631: mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
line 7632: housekeeping, I dare say.”
line 7633: 
line 7634: “No, nothing at all.”
line 7635: 
line 7636: “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will
line 7637: take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
line 7638: for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
line 7639: talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
line 7640: quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”
line 7641: 
line 7642: “It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
line 7643: 
line 7644: “No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
line 7645: often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
line 7646: estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
line 7647: ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”
line 7648: 
line 7649: 
line 7650: 
line 7651: Chapter 41
line 7652: 
line 7653: 
line 7654: The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
line 7655: the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
line 7656: in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
line 7657: universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
line 7658: and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
line 7659: frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
line 7660: Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
line 7661: hard-heartedness in any of the family.
line 7662: 
line 7663: “Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they
line 7664: often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,
line 7665: Lizzy?”
line 7666: 
line 7667: Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
line 7668: she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
line 7669: ago.
line 7670: 
line 7671: “I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel
line 7672: Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”
line 7673: 
line 7674: “I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.
line 7675: 
line 7676: “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
line 7677: 
line 7678: “Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
line 7679: disagreeable.”
line 7680: 
line 7681: “A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”
line 7682: 
line 7683: “And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”
line 7684:  added Kitty.
line 7685: 
line 7686: Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
line 7687: Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
line 7688: of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
line 7689: objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
line 7690: interference in the views of his friend.
line 7691: 
line 7692: But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
line 7693: received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
line 7694: the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
line 7695: very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
line 7696: and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
line 7697: their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
line 7698: 
line 7699: The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
line 7700: the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
line 7701: to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia
line 7702: flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's
line 7703: congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
line 7704: whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
line 7705: in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
line 7706: 
line 7707: “I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”
line 7708:  said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
line 7709: right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”
line 7710: 
line 7711: In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
line 7712: her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
line 7713: exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
line 7714: considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
line 7715: for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
line 7716: known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
line 7717: go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
line 7718: behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
line 7719: such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
line 7720: imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
line 7721: be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:
line 7722: 
line 7723: “Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
line 7724: place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
line 7725: little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
line 7726: circumstances.”
line 7727: 
line 7728: “If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
line 7729: us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
line 7730: imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
line 7731: would judge differently in the affair.”
line 7732: 
line 7733: “Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away
line 7734: some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
line 7735: squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
line 7736: are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
line 7737: have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.”
line 7738: 
line 7739: “Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
line 7740: of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
line 7741: importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
line 7742: wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
line 7743: Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
line 7744: father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
line 7745: of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
line 7746: her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
line 7747: will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
line 7748: that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
line 7749: worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
line 7750: youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
line 7751: of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
line 7752: contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
line 7753: Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
line 7754: ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
line 7755: suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
line 7756: they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
line 7757: disgrace?”
line 7758: 
line 7759: Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
line 7760: affectionately taking her hand said in reply:
line 7761: 
line 7762: “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
line 7763: you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
line 7764: advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
line 7765: sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
line 7766: Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
line 7767: keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
line 7768: object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
line 7769: even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
line 7770: women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
line 7771: there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
line 7772: many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
line 7773: of her life.”
line 7774: 
line 7775: With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
line 7776: continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
line 7777: in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
line 7778: them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
line 7779: over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
line 7780: disposition.
line 7781: 
line 7782: Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
line 7783: father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
line 7784: united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
line 7785: every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
line 7786: of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
line 7787: She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
line 7788: at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
line 7789: stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
line 7790: and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
line 7791: saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
line 7792: officers at once.
line 7793: 
line 7794: Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
line 7795: realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
line 7796: been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
line 7797: Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
line 7798: conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.
line 7799: 
line 7800: But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
line 7801: continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving
line 7802: home.
line 7803: 
line 7804: Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
line 7805: frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
line 7806: well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
line 7807: learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
line 7808: her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
line 7809: behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
line 7810: for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
line 7811: had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
line 7812: what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
line 7813: finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
line 7814: gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
line 7815: reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
line 7816: cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
line 7817: and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
line 7818: 
line 7819: On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,
line 7820: with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
line 7821: disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
line 7822: inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
line 7823: mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
line 7824: weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
line 7825: 
line 7826: He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
line 7827: recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
line 7828: him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
line 7829: asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
line 7830: With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:
line 7831: 
line 7832: “How long did you say he was at Rosings?”
line 7833: 
line 7834: “Nearly three weeks.”
line 7835: 
line 7836: “And you saw him frequently?”
line 7837: 
line 7838: “Yes, almost every day.”
line 7839: 
line 7840: “His manners are very different from his cousin's.”
line 7841: 
line 7842: “Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”
line 7843: 
line 7844: “Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And
line 7845: pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is
line 7846: it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
line 7847: to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower
line 7848: and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”
line 7849: 
line 7850: “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much
line 7851: what he ever was.”
line 7852: 
line 7853: While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
line 7854: rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
line 7855: something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
line 7856: and anxious attention, while she added:
line 7857: 
line 7858: “When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
line 7859: his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
line 7860: knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
line 7861: 
line 7862: Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
line 7863: look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
line 7864: embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
line 7865: accents:
line 7866: 
line 7867: “You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
line 7868: comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
line 7869: even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
line 7870: may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
line 7871: deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
line 7872: fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
line 7873: alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
line 7874: opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
line 7875: operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
line 7876: imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
line 7877: am certain he has very much at heart.”
line 7878: 
line 7879: Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
line 7880: slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
line 7881: the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
line 7882: him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
line 7883: side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
line 7884: Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
line 7885: mutual desire of never meeting again.
line 7886: 
line 7887: When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
line 7888: from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
line 7889: between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
line 7890: only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
line 7891: Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
line 7892: and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
line 7893: opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
line 7894: there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
line 7895: the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
line 7896: gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.
line 7897: 
line 7898: 
line 7899: 
line 7900: Chapter 42
line 7901: 
line 7902: 
line 7903: Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
line 7904: not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
line 7905: comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
line 7906: of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
line 7907: woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
line 7908: their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
line 7909: esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
line 7910: of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
line 7911: a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
line 7912: imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
line 7913: console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
line 7914: the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
line 7915: enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
line 7916: her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
line 7917: the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
line 7918: wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
line 7919: philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
line 7920: 
line 7921: Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
line 7922: father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
line 7923: respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
line 7924: herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
line 7925: banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
line 7926: and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
line 7927: children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
line 7928: strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
line 7929: unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
line 7930: from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
line 7931: might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
line 7932: if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
line 7933: 
line 7934: When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little
line 7935: other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
line 7936: abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
line 7937: sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
line 7938: them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
line 7939: might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
line 7940: of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
line 7941: greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
line 7942: her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
line 7943: watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
line 7944: has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
line 7945: looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
line 7946: satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
line 7947: name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
line 7948: some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
line 7949: again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
line 7950: present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
line 7951: was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
line 7952: for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
line 7953: and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
line 7954: scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
line 7955: 
line 7956: “But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.
line 7957: Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
line 7958: But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
line 7959: sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
line 7960: pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
line 7961: never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
line 7962: the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
line 7963: 
line 7964: When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
line 7965: to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
line 7966: always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
line 7967: they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
line 7968: had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
line 7969: made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
line 7970: she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
line 7971: violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
line 7972: the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
line 7973: less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
line 7974: much too full of lines under the words to be made public.
line 7975: 
line 7976: After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
line 7977: humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
line 7978: a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
line 7979: back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
line 7980: was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
line 7981: June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
line 7982: tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
line 7983: the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
line 7984: mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
line 7985: arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
line 7986: Meryton.
line 7987: 
line 7988: The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
line 7989: approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
line 7990: arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
line 7991: curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
line 7992: setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
line 7993: within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
line 7994: far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
line 7995: the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
line 7996: the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
line 7997: present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
line 7998: county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
line 7999: weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
line 8000: town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
line 8001: they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
line 8002: her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
line 8003: Dovedale, or the Peak.
line 8004: 
line 8005: Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
line 8006: the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
line 8007: was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
line 8008: and all was soon right again.
line 8009: 
line 8010: With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
line 8011: impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
line 8012: owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,
line 8013: and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”
line 8014: 
line 8015: The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
line 8016: before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
line 8017: and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
line 8018: Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
line 8019: younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
line 8020: cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
line 8021: sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
line 8022: way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
line 8023: 
line 8024: The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
line 8025: next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
line 8026: One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
line 8027: a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
line 8028: inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
line 8029: and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
line 8030: disappointments abroad.
line 8031: 
line 8032: It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
line 8033: nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
line 8034: lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
line 8035: sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
line 8036: concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
line 8037: former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
line 8038: still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
line 8039: principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
line 8040: Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
line 8041: in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
line 8042: talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
line 8043: an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
line 8044: willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
line 8045: 
line 8046: “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
line 8047: so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your
line 8048: acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
line 8049: know.”
line 8050: 
line 8051: Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
line 8052: Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
line 8053: must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
line 8054: many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
line 8055: 
line 8056: Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house
line 8057: richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but
line 8058: the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
line 8059: country.”
line 8060: 
line 8061: Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
line 8062: possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
line 8063: occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
line 8064: thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
line 8065: a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
line 8066: that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
line 8067: absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
line 8068: 
line 8069: Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
line 8070: whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
line 8071: proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
line 8072: the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
line 8073: alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
line 8074: curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
line 8075: next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
line 8076: with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
line 8077: to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
line 8078: 
line 8079: 
line 8080: 
line 8081: Chapter 43
line 8082: 
line 8083: 
line 8084: Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
line 8085: Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
line 8086: in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
line 8087: 
line 8088: The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
line 8089: entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
line 8090: a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
line 8091: 
line 8092: Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
line 8093: every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
line 8094: half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
line 8095: eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
line 8096: Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
line 8097: the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
line 8098: building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
line 8099: high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
line 8100: swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
line 8101: were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
line 8102: had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
line 8103: beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
line 8104: all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
line 8105: to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
line 8106: 
line 8107: They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
line 8108: while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
line 8109: meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
line 8110: mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
line 8111: hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
line 8112: wonder at her being where she was.
line 8113: 
line 8114: The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
line 8115: fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
line 8116: followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
line 8117: room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
line 8118: to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
line 8119: they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
line 8120: was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
line 8121: she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
line 8122: banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
line 8123: with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
line 8124: different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
line 8125: seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
line 8126: the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
line 8127: his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
line 8128: splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
line 8129: 
line 8130: “And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With
line 8131: these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
line 8132: viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
line 8133: welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting
line 8134: herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
line 8135: me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”
line 8136: 
line 8137: This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
line 8138: regret.
line 8139: 
line 8140: She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
line 8141: absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
line 8142: was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
line 8143: Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with
line 8144: a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
line 8145: journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
line 8146: 
line 8147: Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
line 8148: likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
line 8149: over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
line 8150: The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
line 8151: gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought
line 8152: up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;
line 8153: “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”
line 8154: 
line 8155: Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
line 8156: return it.
line 8157: 
line 8158: “And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
line 8159: “is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
line 8160: other--about eight years ago.”
line 8161: 
line 8162: “I have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
line 8163: looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
line 8164: us whether it is like or not.”
line 8165: 
line 8166: Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
line 8167: intimation of her knowing her master.
line 8168: 
line 8169: “Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”
line 8170: 
line 8171: Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”
line 8172: 
line 8173: “And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?”
line 8174: 
line 8175: “Yes, very handsome.”
line 8176: 
line 8177: “I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
line 8178: will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
line 8179: master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
line 8180: be then. He was very fond of them.”
line 8181: 
line 8182: This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.
line 8183: 
line 8184: Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
line 8185: when she was only eight years old.
line 8186: 
line 8187: “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.
line 8188: 
line 8189: “Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
line 8190: accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
line 8191: a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
line 8192: comes here to-morrow with him.”
line 8193: 
line 8194: Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
line 8195: communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
line 8196: by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
line 8197: master and his sister.
line 8198: 
line 8199: “Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”
line 8200: 
line 8201: “Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
line 8202: time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”
line 8203: 
line 8204: “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”
line 8205: 
line 8206: “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
line 8207: 
line 8208: “Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
line 8209: good enough for him.”
line 8210: 
line 8211: Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is
line 8212: very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”
line 8213: 
line 8214: “I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”
line 8215:  replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
line 8216: listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have
line 8217: never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
line 8218: since he was four years old.”
line 8219: 
line 8220: This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
line 8221: ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
line 8222: Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
line 8223: grateful to her uncle for saying:
line 8224: 
line 8225: “There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
line 8226: having such a master.”
line 8227: 
line 8228: “Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
line 8229: not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
line 8230: good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
line 8231: he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
line 8232: world.”
line 8233: 
line 8234: Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
line 8235: 
line 8236: “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
line 8237: 
line 8238: “Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
line 8239: as affable to the poor.”
line 8240: 
line 8241: Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
line 8242: Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
line 8243: of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
line 8244: furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
line 8245: prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
line 8246: master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
line 8247: many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
line 8248: 
line 8249: “He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
line 8250: lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
line 8251: themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
line 8252: him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
line 8253: anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
line 8254: like other young men.”
line 8255: 
line 8256: “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.
line 8257: 
line 8258: “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
line 8259: quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
line 8260: 
line 8261: “Perhaps we might be deceived.”
line 8262: 
line 8263: “That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
line 8264: 
line 8265: On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
line 8266: sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
line 8267: the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
line 8268: give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
line 8269: last at Pemberley.
line 8270: 
line 8271: “He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
line 8272: one of the windows.
line 8273: 
line 8274: Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
line 8275: the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever
line 8276: can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
line 8277: is nothing he would not do for her.”
line 8278: 
line 8279: The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
line 8280: all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
line 8281: but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
line 8282: visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
line 8283: Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
line 8284: also more intelligible.
line 8285: 
line 8286: In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
line 8287: little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
line 8288: the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
line 8289: her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
line 8290: smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
line 8291: looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
line 8292: contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
line 8293: Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's
line 8294: lifetime.
line 8295: 
line 8296: There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
line 8297: sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
line 8298: their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
line 8299: was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
line 8300: of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
line 8301: considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
line 8302: much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
line 8303: good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
line 8304: forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
line 8305: stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
line 8306: eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
line 8307: gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
line 8308: softened its impropriety of expression.
line 8309: 
line 8310: When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
line 8311: they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
line 8312: consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
line 8313: 
line 8314: As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
line 8315: to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
line 8316: was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
line 8317: suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
line 8318: 
line 8319: They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
line 8320: appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
line 8321: instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
line 8322: blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
line 8323: surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
line 8324: and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
line 8325: of perfect civility.
line 8326: 
line 8327: She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
line 8328: received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
line 8329: overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
line 8330: they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
line 8331: that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
line 8332: beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
line 8333: aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
line 8334: scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
line 8335: she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
line 8336: alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
line 8337: he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
line 8338: impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
line 8339: minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
line 8340: her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
line 8341: had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
line 8342: to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
line 8343: Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
line 8344: distraction of his thoughts.
line 8345: 
line 8346: At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
line 8347: moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
line 8348: leave.
line 8349: 
line 8350: The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
line 8351: Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
line 8352: followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
line 8353: coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
line 8354: world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
line 8355: might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
line 8356: thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
line 8357: thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
line 8358: sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
line 8359: for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
line 8360: from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
line 8361: the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
line 8362: altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
line 8363: amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
line 8364: Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
line 8365: had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
line 8366: a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
line 8367: his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
line 8368: for it.
line 8369: 
line 8370: They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
line 8371: every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
line 8372: reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
line 8373: before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
line 8374: mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
line 8375: seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
line 8376: distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
line 8377: one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
line 8378: was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
line 8379: what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
line 8380: she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
line 8381: felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
line 8382: not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
line 8383: seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
line 8384: composure.
line 8385: 
line 8386: At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
line 8387: aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
line 8388: 
line 8389: They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
line 8390: ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
line 8391: the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
line 8392: valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
line 8393: many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
line 8394: of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
line 8395: With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
line 8396: It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
line 8397: brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
line 8398: to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
line 8399: it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
line 8400: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
line 8401: valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
line 8402: and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
line 8403: Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
line 8404: bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
line 8405: who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
line 8406: of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
line 8407: therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
line 8408: on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
line 8409: progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
line 8410: taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
line 8411: occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
line 8412: man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
line 8413: slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment
line 8414: was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
line 8415: approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
line 8416: less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
line 8417: they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
line 8418: for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
line 8419: calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
line 8420: she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
line 8421: lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
line 8422: turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
line 8423: that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
line 8424: politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
line 8425: but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when
line 8426: some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
line 8427: Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
line 8428: and she said no more.
line 8429: 
line 8430: Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
line 8431: her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
line 8432: This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
line 8433: and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
line 8434: acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
line 8435: revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought
line 8436: she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
line 8437: fashion.”
line 8438: 
line 8439: The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
line 8440: relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
line 8441: it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
line 8442: could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
line 8443: connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
line 8444: so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
line 8445: conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
line 8446: could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
line 8447: some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
line 8448: attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
line 8449: expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
line 8450: his taste, or his good manners.
line 8451: 
line 8452: The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
line 8453: invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
line 8454: chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
line 8455: to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
line 8456: the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
line 8457: walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
line 8458: Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
line 8459: must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
line 8460: continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can
line 8461: it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
line 8462: manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
line 8463: change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”
line 8464: 
line 8465: After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
line 8466: gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
line 8467: the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
line 8468: water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
line 8469: in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
line 8470: Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
line 8471: her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
line 8472: together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
line 8473: to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
line 8474: place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
line 8475: very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
line 8476: you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
line 8477: left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
line 8478: in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
line 8479: business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
line 8480: before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They
line 8481: will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some
line 8482: who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”
line 8483: 
line 8484: Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
line 8485: driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last
line 8486: mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
line 8487: mind was not very differently engaged.
line 8488: 
line 8489: “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
line 8490: pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
line 8491: me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
line 8492: during your stay at Lambton?”
line 8493: 
line 8494: The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
line 8495: for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
line 8496: that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
line 8497: must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
line 8498: satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
line 8499: him think really ill of her.
line 8500: 
line 8501: They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
line 8502: was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
line 8503: pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
line 8504: the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
line 8505: reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
line 8506: mile behind.
line 8507: 
line 8508: He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
line 8509: tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
line 8510: have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
line 8511: there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
line 8512: that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
line 8513: with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
line 8514: patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
line 8515: over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go
line 8516: into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
line 8517: they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
line 8518: ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
line 8519: walking slowly towards the house.
line 8520: 
line 8521: The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
line 8522: pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
line 8523: “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
line 8524: 
line 8525: “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
line 8526: aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
line 8527: say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
line 8528: have seen nothing of it.”
line 8529: 
line 8530: “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
line 8531: than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
line 8532: attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”
line 8533: 
line 8534: “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;
line 8535: or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features
line 8536: are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
line 8537: disagreeable?”
line 8538: 
line 8539: Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
line 8540: him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
line 8541: seen him so pleasant as this morning.
line 8542: 
line 8543: “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
line 8544: her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
line 8545: at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
line 8546: his grounds.”
line 8547: 
line 8548: Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
line 8549: said nothing.
line 8550: 
line 8551: “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really
line 8552: should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
line 8553: anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
line 8554: On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
line 8555: speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
line 8556: not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
line 8557: good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
line 8558: I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
line 8559: master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
line 8560: virtue.”
line 8561: 
line 8562: Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
line 8563: his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
line 8564: as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
line 8565: his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
line 8566: construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
line 8567: Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
line 8568: confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
line 8569: transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
line 8570: her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
line 8571: 
line 8572: Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
line 8573: approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
line 8574: the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
line 8575: to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
line 8576: anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they
line 8577: had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
line 8578: acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
line 8579: intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.
line 8580: 
line 8581: The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
line 8582: much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
line 8583: but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above
line 8584: all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
line 8585: 
line 8586: 
line 8587: 
line 8588: Chapter 44
line 8589: 
line 8590: 
line 8591: Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
line 8592: her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
line 8593: resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
line 8594: But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
line 8595: arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
line 8596: place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
line 8597: to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
line 8598: carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
line 8599: a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
line 8600: the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
line 8601: surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
line 8602: expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
line 8603: of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
line 8604: of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
line 8605: the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
line 8606: there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
line 8607: quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
line 8608: newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
line 8609: Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
line 8610: amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
line 8611: she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
line 8612: in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
line 8613: suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
line 8614: 
line 8615: She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
line 8616: up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
line 8617: inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
line 8618: 
line 8619: Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
line 8620: took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
line 8621: acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
line 8622: being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
line 8623: but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
line 8624: only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
line 8625: her beyond a monosyllable.
line 8626: 
line 8627: Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
line 8628: little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
line 8629: womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
line 8630: was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
line 8631: unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
line 8632: acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
line 8633: relieved by discerning such different feelings.
line 8634: 
line 8635: They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
line 8636: was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
line 8637: satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick
line 8638: step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
line 8639: Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
line 8640: felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
line 8641: cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
line 8642: inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
line 8643: and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
line 8644: 
line 8645: To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
line 8646: than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
line 8647: them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
line 8648: arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
line 8649: each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
line 8650: those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
line 8651: what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little
line 8652: in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
line 8653: evident enough.
line 8654: 
line 8655: Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
line 8656: feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
line 8657: to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
line 8658: feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
line 8659: endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
line 8660: was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
line 8661: 
line 8662: In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
line 8663: how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
line 8664: a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
line 8665: former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
line 8666: that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
line 8667: though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
line 8668: behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
line 8669: appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
line 8670: between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
line 8671: she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
line 8672: ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
line 8673: recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
line 8674: more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
line 8675: to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
line 8676: which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since
line 8677: he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,
line 8678: he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
line 8679: November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”
line 8680: 
line 8681: Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
line 8682: took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
line 8683: _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
line 8684: nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
line 8685: gave them meaning.
line 8686: 
line 8687: It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
line 8688: but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
line 8689: complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
line 8690: from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
line 8691: the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
line 8692: temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
line 8693: she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
line 8694: of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
line 8695: disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
line 8696: very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
line 8697: lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
line 8698: so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
line 8699: restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
line 8700: of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
line 8701: at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
line 8702: self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
line 8703: could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
line 8704: acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
line 8705: down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
line 8706: Rosings.
line 8707: 
line 8708: Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
line 8709: to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
line 8710: their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
line 8711: at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
line 8712: diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
line 8713: readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
line 8714: how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
line 8715: acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
line 8716: that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
line 8717: any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
line 8718: society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
line 8719: her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
line 8720: 
line 8721: Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
line 8722: again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
line 8723: make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
line 8724: this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
line 8725: this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
line 8726: visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
line 8727: satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
line 8728: little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
line 8729: uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
line 8730: favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
line 8731: 
line 8732: But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
line 8733: not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
line 8734: much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
line 8735: it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
line 8736: interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
line 8737: 
line 8738: Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
line 8739: as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
line 8740: not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
line 8741: from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference
line 8742: to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
line 8743: would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
line 8744: however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
line 8745: that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
line 8746: years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
line 8747: hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
line 8748: their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
line 8749: nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
line 8750: it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
line 8751: where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
line 8752: was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
line 8753: 
line 8754: With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
line 8755: there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
line 8756: son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
line 8757: fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
line 8758: him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
line 8759: 
line 8760: As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
line 8761: the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
line 8762: long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
line 8763: and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
line 8764: certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
line 8765: had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
line 8766: that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
line 8767: valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
line 8768: time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
line 8769: into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
line 8770: his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
line 8771: which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
line 8772: there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
line 8773: It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
line 8774: but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
line 8775: acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
line 8776: accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
line 8777: her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
line 8778: eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
line 8779: of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
line 8780: were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
line 8781: on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
line 8782: pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
line 8783: love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
line 8784: sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
line 8785: exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
line 8786: she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
line 8787: far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
line 8788: be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
line 8789: fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
line 8790: his addresses.
line 8791: 
line 8792: It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
line 8793: such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the
line 8794: very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
line 8795: late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
line 8796: by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
line 8797: it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
line 8798: morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
line 8799: she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
line 8800: 
line 8801: Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
line 8802: renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
line 8803: some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
line 8804: 
line 8805: 
line 8806: 
line 8807: Chapter 45
line 8808: 
line 8809: 
line 8810: Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
line 8811: originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
line 8812: appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
line 8813: much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.
line 8814: 
line 8815: On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
line 8816: whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
line 8817: opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
line 8818: hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
line 8819: which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
line 8820: 
line 8821: In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
line 8822: with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
line 8823: London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with
line 8824: all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
line 8825: of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
line 8826: the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
line 8827: however, did her justice, and pitied her.
line 8828: 
line 8829: By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
line 8830: on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
line 8831: succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
line 8832: genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
line 8833: of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
line 8834: others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
line 8835: Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
line 8836: wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
line 8837: short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.
line 8838: 
line 8839: Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
line 8840: and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
line 8841: calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
line 8842: from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
line 8843: inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
line 8844: of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
line 8845: moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
line 8846: feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
line 8847: she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
line 8848: sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
line 8849: Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
line 8850: inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
line 8851: indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
line 8852: 
line 8853: The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
line 8854: entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
line 8855: finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
line 8856: a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
line 8857: given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
line 8858: party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
line 8859: beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
line 8860: them round the table.
line 8861: 
line 8862: While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
line 8863: she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
line 8864: feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
line 8865: a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
line 8866: regret that he came.
line 8867: 
line 8868: He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
line 8869: gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
line 8870: only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
line 8871: Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
line 8872: resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
line 8873: necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
line 8874: saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
line 8875: and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
line 8876: when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
line 8877: curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
line 8878: smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
line 8879: objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
line 8880: to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's
line 8881: entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
line 8882: was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
line 8883: as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
line 8884: Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
line 8885: first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:
line 8886: 
line 8887: “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
line 8888: They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”
line 8889: 
line 8890: In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
line 8891: instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
line 8892: various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
line 8893: but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
line 8894: presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
line 8895: she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
line 8896: complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
line 8897: confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
line 8898: pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
line 8899: have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
line 8900: Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
line 8901: her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
line 8902: Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
line 8903: and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
line 8904: with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's
line 8905: meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
line 8906: was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections
line 8907: her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
line 8908: wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
line 8909: hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
line 8910: meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
line 8911: Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
line 8912: for the welfare of his friend.
line 8913: 
line 8914: Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
line 8915: as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
line 8916: Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
line 8917: to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
line 8918: recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
line 8919: had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
line 8920: fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
line 8921: 
line 8922: Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
line 8923: mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
line 8924: Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,
line 8925: behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's
line 8926: recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
line 8927: err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
line 8928: without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
line 8929: Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
line 8930: him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
line 8931: 
line 8932: “How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she
line 8933: cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
line 8934: the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
line 8935: that we should not have known her again.”
line 8936: 
line 8937: However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
line 8938: himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
line 8939: her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
line 8940: summer.
line 8941: 
line 8942: “For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could
line 8943: see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
line 8944: brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
line 8945: wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
line 8946: tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,
line 8947: which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
line 8948: extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
line 8949: not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
line 8950: without fashion, which is intolerable.”
line 8951: 
line 8952: Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
line 8953: the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
line 8954: wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
line 8955: success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
line 8956: determination of making him speak, she continued:
line 8957: 
line 8958: “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
line 8959: were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
line 8960: your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
line 8961: a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
line 8962: seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
line 8963: one time.”
line 8964: 
line 8965: “Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_
line 8966: was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
line 8967: considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
line 8968: 
line 8969: He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
line 8970: having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
line 8971: 
line 8972: Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
line 8973: visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
line 8974: both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
line 8975: except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
line 8976: of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
line 8977: himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
line 8978: him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's
line 8979: beginning the subject.
line 8980: 
line 8981: 
line 8982: 
line 8983: Chapter 46
line 8984: 
line 8985: 
line 8986: Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
line 8987: Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
line 8988: renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
line 8989: on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
line 8990: receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
line 8991: it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
line 8992: Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
line 8993: 
line 8994: They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
line 8995: her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
line 8996: themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
line 8997: written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
line 8998: little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
line 8999: but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
line 9000: agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:
line 9001: 
line 9002: “Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
line 9003: most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
line 9004: assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
line 9005: An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
line 9006: from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
line 9007: with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
line 9008: surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
line 9009: very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
line 9010: to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
line 9011: Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
line 9012: (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
line 9013: disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
line 9014: Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
line 9015: thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
line 9016: him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
line 9017: twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
line 9018: eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
line 9019: passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
line 9020: him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
line 9021: their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
line 9022: mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
line 9023: know what I have written.”
line 9024: 
line 9025: Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
line 9026: what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
line 9027: other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
line 9028: had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
line 9029: 
line 9030: “By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
line 9031: wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
line 9032: head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
line 9033: Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
line 9034: and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
line 9035: and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
line 9036: taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
line 9037: to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
line 9038: day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short
line 9039: letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
line 9040: Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
line 9041: never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
line 9042: repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
line 9043: intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
line 9044: but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
line 9045: coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
line 9046: is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
line 9047: I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
line 9048: side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
line 9049: them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
line 9050: without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
line 9051: the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
line 9052: to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
line 9053: for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
line 9054: distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
line 9055: worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
line 9056: it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
line 9057: their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
line 9058: young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
line 9059: her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
line 9060: Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
line 9061: head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
line 9062: be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
line 9063: exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
line 9064: as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
line 9065: anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
line 9066: confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
line 9067: have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
line 9068: first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
line 9069: so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
line 9070: take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
line 9071: circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
line 9072: come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
line 9073: that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
line 9074: more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
line 9075: Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
line 9076: I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
line 9077: measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
line 9078: be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
line 9079: uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
line 9080: immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”
line 9081: 
line 9082: “Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
line 9083: as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
line 9084: a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
line 9085: opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
line 9086: manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
line 9087: she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,
line 9088: hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
line 9089: Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
line 9090: an instant to lose.”
line 9091: 
line 9092: “Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
line 9093: politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;
line 9094: but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
line 9095: not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
line 9096: 
line 9097: Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
line 9098: little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
line 9099: the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
line 9100: an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
line 9101: mistress home instantly.
line 9102: 
line 9103: On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
line 9104: looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
line 9105: or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
line 9106: “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
line 9107: present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”
line 9108: 
line 9109: “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There
line 9110: is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
line 9111: some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
line 9112: 
line 9113: She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
line 9114: not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
line 9115: something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
line 9116: silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,
line 9117: with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
line 9118: sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
line 9119: the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
line 9120: _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
line 9121: connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”
line 9122: 
line 9123: Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet
line 9124: more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
line 9125: he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
line 9126: learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
line 9127: have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”
line 9128: 
line 9129: “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it
line 9130: certain--absolutely certain?”
line 9131: 
line 9132: “Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
line 9133: almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
line 9134: Scotland.”
line 9135: 
line 9136: “And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
line 9137: 
line 9138: “My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
line 9139: immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
line 9140: nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
line 9141: such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
line 9142: not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”
line 9143: 
line 9144: Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
line 9145: 
line 9146: “When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
line 9147: I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
line 9148: much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”
line 9149: 
line 9150: Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
line 9151: up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
line 9152: gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
line 9153: power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
line 9154: weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
line 9155: wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
line 9156: consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
line 9157: was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
line 9158: wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
line 9159: him, as now, when all love must be vain.
line 9160: 
line 9161: But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
line 9162: humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
line 9163: up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
line 9164: Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
line 9165: several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
line 9166: the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
line 9167: compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been
line 9168: long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
line 9169: stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
line 9170: could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
line 9171: such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
line 9172: seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
line 9173: fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
line 9174: to-day.”
line 9175: 
line 9176: “Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
line 9177: urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
line 9178: long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”
line 9179: 
line 9180: He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
line 9181: her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
line 9182: reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
line 9183: one serious, parting look, went away.
line 9184: 
line 9185: As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
line 9186: should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
line 9187: had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
line 9188: retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
line 9189: of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
line 9190: feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
line 9191: formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
line 9192: 
line 9193: If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
line 9194: change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
line 9195: otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
line 9196: unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
line 9197: a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
line 9198: exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
line 9199: somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
line 9200: and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
line 9201: less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
line 9202: go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
line 9203: produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
line 9204: business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
line 9205: a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
line 9206: could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
line 9207: of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
line 9208: letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
line 9209: Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
line 9210: for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
line 9211: incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
line 9212: as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
line 9213: Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
line 9214: of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
line 9215: nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
line 9216: 
line 9217: She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
line 9218: Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
line 9219: wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
line 9220: officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
line 9221: raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
line 9222: fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
line 9223: mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
line 9224: feel it!
line 9225: 
line 9226: She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
line 9227: share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
line 9228: family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
line 9229: requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
line 9230: could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
line 9231: importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
line 9232: and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's
line 9233: account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
line 9234: instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
line 9235: summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
line 9236: of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
line 9237: favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
line 9238: afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
line 9239: first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
line 9240: assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
line 9241: him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
line 9242: everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
line 9243: be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”
line 9244:  cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
line 9245: us; was it so?”
line 9246: 
line 9247: “Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
line 9248: _That_ is all settled.”
line 9249: 
line 9250: “What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
line 9251: prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
line 9252: truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”
line 9253: 
line 9254: But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
line 9255: hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
line 9256: to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
line 9257: impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
line 9258: business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
line 9259: be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
line 9260: sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
line 9261: Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
line 9262: remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
line 9263: the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
line 9264: have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
line 9265: 
line 9266: 
line 9267: 
line 9268: Chapter 47
line 9269: 
line 9270: 
line 9271: “I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
line 9272: drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
line 9273: more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
line 9274: matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
line 9275: form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
line 9276: friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
line 9277: am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
line 9278: would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
line 9279: regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
line 9280: not adequate to the risk!”
line 9281: 
line 9282: “Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
line 9283: 
line 9284: “Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's
line 9285: opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
line 9286: interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
line 9287: Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
line 9288: him capable of it?”
line 9289: 
line 9290: “Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
line 9291: neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
line 9292: dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
line 9293: the case?”
line 9294: 
line 9295: “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
line 9296: that they are not gone to Scotland.”
line 9297: 
line 9298: “Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
line 9299: a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
line 9300: Barnet road.”
line 9301: 
line 9302: “Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
line 9303: for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
line 9304: not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
line 9305: might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
line 9306: expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”
line 9307: 
line 9308: “But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
line 9309: marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
line 9310: friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
line 9311: to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
line 9312: cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
line 9313: beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
line 9314: forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
line 9315: restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
line 9316: dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
line 9317: nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
line 9318: other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
line 9319: no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
line 9320: behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
line 9321: seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
line 9322: do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
line 9323: such a matter.”
line 9324: 
line 9325: “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
line 9326: as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”
line 9327: 
line 9328: “It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with
line 9329: tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
line 9330: a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
line 9331: Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
line 9332: been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
line 9333: nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
line 9334: and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
line 9335: and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
line 9336: Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
line 9337: flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
line 9338: everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
line 9339: greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
line 9340: naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
line 9341: person and address that can captivate a woman.”
line 9342: 
line 9343: “But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of
line 9344: Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
line 9345: 
line 9346: “Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
line 9347: their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
line 9348: till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
line 9349: Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
line 9350: sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
line 9351: as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”
line 9352: 
line 9353: “And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
line 9354: as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
line 9355: 
line 9356: “I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,
line 9357: of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
line 9358: Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
line 9359: with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
line 9360: circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
line 9361: relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
line 9362: what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
line 9363: reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
line 9364: must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
line 9365: her.”
line 9366: 
line 9367: “But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
line 9368: and Jane seem so well to understand?”
line 9369: 
line 9370: “Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
line 9371: so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
line 9372: ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
line 9373: was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
line 9374: case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
line 9375: necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
line 9376: it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
line 9377: neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
line 9378: settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
line 9379: her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
line 9380: in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
line 9381: consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
line 9382: enough from my thoughts.”
line 9383: 
line 9384: “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
line 9385: suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
line 9386: 
line 9387: “Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
line 9388: side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
line 9389: that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
line 9390: he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
line 9391: were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
line 9392: the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
line 9393: attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
line 9394: wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
line 9395: who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”
line 9396: 
line 9397:                           * * * * *
line 9398: 
line 9399: It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
line 9400: to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
line 9401: its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
line 9402: the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
line 9403: Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
line 9404: no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
line 9405: 
line 9406: They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
line 9407: on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
line 9408: comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
line 9409: by long expectations.
line 9410: 
line 9411: The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
line 9412: on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
line 9413: carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
line 9414: faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
line 9415: capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
line 9416: 
line 9417: Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
line 9418: hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
line 9419: mother's apartment, immediately met her.
line 9420: 
line 9421: Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
line 9422: eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
line 9423: heard of the fugitives.
line 9424: 
line 9425: “Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
line 9426: everything will be well.”
line 9427: 
line 9428: “Is my father in town?”
line 9429: 
line 9430: “Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”
line 9431: 
line 9432: “And have you heard from him often?”
line 9433: 
line 9434: “We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
line 9435: that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
line 9436: particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
line 9437: again till he had something of importance to mention.”
line 9438: 
line 9439: “And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”
line 9440: 
line 9441: “My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
line 9442: shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
line 9443: all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
line 9444: Heaven, are quite well.”
line 9445: 
line 9446: “But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you
line 9447: must have gone through!”
line 9448: 
line 9449: Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
line 9450: conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
line 9451: engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
line 9452: of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
line 9453: thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
line 9454: 
line 9455: When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
line 9456: had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
line 9457: found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
line 9458: good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
line 9459: deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
line 9460: every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
line 9461: to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.
line 9462: 
line 9463: Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'
line 9464: conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
line 9465: tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
line 9466: conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
line 9467: blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
line 9468: errors of her daughter must principally be owing.
line 9469: 
line 9470: “If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,
line 9471: with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
line 9472: had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
line 9473: of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
line 9474: side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
line 9475: well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
line 9476: charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
line 9477: And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
line 9478: wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
line 9479: of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
line 9480: grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
line 9481: shall do.”
line 9482: 
line 9483: They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
line 9484: general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
line 9485: that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
line 9486: Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
line 9487: 
line 9488: “Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be
line 9489: prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
line 9490: It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
line 9491: may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
line 9492: and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
line 9493: lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
line 9494: him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
line 9495: together as to what is to be done.”
line 9496: 
line 9497: “Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I
line 9498: could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
line 9499: wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
line 9500: marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
line 9501: tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
line 9502: after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
line 9503: Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
line 9504: wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
line 9505: spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
line 9506: I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
line 9507: give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
line 9508: not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
line 9509: know you will contrive it all.”
line 9510: 
line 9511: But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
line 9512: in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
line 9513: in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
line 9514: dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
line 9515: the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
line 9516: 
line 9517: Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
line 9518: occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
line 9519: oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
line 9520: tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
line 9521: better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
line 9522: most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
line 9523: subject.
line 9524: 
line 9525: In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
line 9526: too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
line 9527: before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
line 9528: faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
line 9529: in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
line 9530: which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
line 9531: fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
line 9532: mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
line 9533: of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:
line 9534: 
line 9535: “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
line 9536: But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
line 9537: each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
line 9538: 
line 9539: Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
line 9540: “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
line 9541: lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
line 9542: false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
line 9543: brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
line 9544: her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
line 9545: 
line 9546: Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
line 9547: to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
line 9548: kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
line 9549: 
line 9550: In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
line 9551: half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
line 9552: the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
line 9553: satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
line 9554: of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
line 9555: Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
line 9556: the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which
line 9557: I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
line 9558: Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
line 9559: took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”
line 9560: 
line 9561: “Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
line 9562: especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
line 9563: grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
line 9564: _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
line 9565: any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
line 9566: first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
line 9567: 
line 9568: “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
line 9569: their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”
line 9570: 
line 9571: “Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
line 9572: their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
line 9573: repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
line 9574: inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”
line 9575: 
line 9576: “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
line 9577: doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”
line 9578: 
line 9579: “How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
line 9580: a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him
line 9581: in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
line 9582: right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
line 9583: imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
line 9584: triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter
line 9585: she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
line 9586: being in love with each other, many weeks.”
line 9587: 
line 9588: “But not before they went to Brighton?”
line 9589: 
line 9590: “No, I believe not.”
line 9591: 
line 9592: “And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
line 9593: he know his real character?”
line 9594: 
line 9595: “I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
line 9596: did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
line 9597: affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
line 9598: but I hope this may be false.”
line 9599: 
line 9600: “Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
line 9601: this could not have happened!”
line 9602: 
line 9603: “Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose
line 9604: the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
line 9605: feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”
line 9606: 
line 9607: “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
line 9608: wife?”
line 9609: 
line 9610: “He brought it with him for us to see.”
line 9611: 
line 9612: Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
line 9613: were the contents:
line 9614: 
line 9615: “MY DEAR HARRIET,
line 9616: 
line 9617: “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
line 9618: laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
line 9619: missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
line 9620: I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
line 9621: love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
line 9622: it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
line 9623: going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
line 9624: when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke
line 9625: it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
line 9626: Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
line 9627: Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
line 9628: dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
line 9629: send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
line 9630: Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
line 9631: packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
line 9632: drink to our good journey.
line 9633: 
line 9634: “Your affectionate friend,
line 9635: 
line 9636: “LYDIA BENNET.”
line 9637: 
line 9638: “Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
line 9639: finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
line 9640: But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
line 9641: journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
line 9642: side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”
line 9643: 
line 9644: “I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
line 9645: minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
line 9646: such confusion!”
line 9647: 
line 9648: “Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
line 9649: did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
line 9650: 
line 9651: “I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
line 9652: very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
line 9653: give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
line 9654: much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
line 9655: almost took from me my faculties.”
line 9656: 
line 9657: “Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
line 9658: well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
line 9659: upon yourself alone.”
line 9660: 
line 9661: “Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
line 9662: fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
line 9663: Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
line 9664: of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
line 9665: on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
line 9666: Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
line 9667: Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
line 9668: condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if
line 9669: they should be of use to us.”
line 9670: 
line 9671: “She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she
line 9672: _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
line 9673: too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
line 9674: insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”
line 9675: 
line 9676: She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
line 9677: intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
line 9678: 
line 9679: “He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where
line 9680: they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
line 9681: be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
line 9682: number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
line 9683: with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
line 9684: gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might
line 9685: be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
line 9686: discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
line 9687: determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
line 9688: to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
line 9689: other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
line 9690: and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
line 9691: out even so much as this.”
line 9692: 
line 9693: 
line 9694: 
line 9695: Chapter 48
line 9696: 
line 9697: 
line 9698: The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
line 9699: morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
line 9700: His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
line 9701: dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
line 9702: They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
line 9703: send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
line 9704: Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
line 9705: 
line 9706: When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
line 9707: information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
line 9708: to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
line 9709: to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
line 9710: security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.
line 9711: 
line 9712: Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
line 9713: days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
line 9714: to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
line 9715: great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
line 9716: visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
line 9717: cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
line 9718: reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
line 9719: she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
line 9720: them.
line 9721: 
line 9722: All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
line 9723: before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
line 9724: to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
line 9725: the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
line 9726: Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
line 9727: and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
line 9728: appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
line 9729: half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
line 9730: her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
line 9731: of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
line 9732: when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
line 9733: despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
line 9734: them.
line 9735: 
line 9736: Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
line 9737: letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
line 9738: found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
line 9739: that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
line 9740: but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
line 9741: determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
line 9742: thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
line 9743: coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
line 9744: did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
line 9745: eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
line 9746: Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
line 9747: to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:
line 9748: 
line 9749: “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
line 9750: possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
line 9751: whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
line 9752: know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
line 9753: anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
line 9754: clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
line 9755: nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
line 9756: his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
line 9757: Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
line 9758: other person.”
line 9759: 
line 9760: Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
line 9761: authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
line 9762: of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
line 9763: heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
line 9764: of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
line 9765: his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
line 9766: and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
line 9767: was a something to look forward to.
line 9768: 
line 9769: Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
line 9770: part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
line 9771: was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
line 9772: whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
line 9773: succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
line 9774: 
line 9775: But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
line 9776: their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
line 9777: had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
line 9778: she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
line 9779: letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
line 9780: follows:
line 9781: 
line 9782: “MY DEAR SIR,
line 9783: 
line 9784: “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
line 9785: in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
line 9786: suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
line 9787: Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
line 9788: sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
line 9789: your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
line 9790: proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
line 9791: wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
line 9792: may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
line 9793: most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would
line 9794: have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
line 9795: be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
line 9796: informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
line 9797: proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
line 9798: for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
line 9799: that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
line 9800: guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
line 9801: you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
line 9802: by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
line 9803: whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
line 9804: this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
line 9805: all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
line 9806: will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
line 9807: me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
line 9808: of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
line 9809: in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
line 9810: console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
line 9811: from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
line 9812: own heinous offense.
line 9813: 
line 9814: “I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”
line 9815: 
line 9816: Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
line 9817: Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
line 9818: It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
line 9819: kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
line 9820: living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
line 9821: had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
line 9822: particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
line 9823: who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
line 9824: wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
line 9825: secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for
line 9826: it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
line 9827: very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
line 9828: thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
line 9829: He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
line 9830: formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
line 9831: from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”
line 9832:  she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”
line 9833: 
line 9834: Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
line 9835: father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
line 9836: spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
line 9837: to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and
line 9838: leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
line 9839: for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
line 9840: not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
line 9841: what her anxiety for his life had been before.
line 9842: 
line 9843: “What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he
line 9844: will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
line 9845: and make him marry her, if he comes away?”
line 9846: 
line 9847: As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
line 9848: and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
line 9849: came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
line 9850: journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
line 9851: 
line 9852: Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
line 9853: Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
line 9854: name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
line 9855: the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
line 9856: being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
line 9857: received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
line 9858: 
line 9859: The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
line 9860: the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
line 9861: fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
line 9862: tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
line 9863: that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
line 9864: Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
line 9865: one sleepless night out of two.
line 9866: 
line 9867: When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
line 9868: philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
line 9869: habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
line 9870: away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
line 9871: it.
line 9872: 
line 9873: It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
line 9874: Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
line 9875: expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
line 9876: nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
line 9877: and I ought to feel it.”
line 9878: 
line 9879: “You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.
line 9880: 
line 9881: “You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
line 9882: to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
line 9883: been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
line 9884: It will pass away soon enough.”
line 9885: 
line 9886: “Do you suppose them to be in London?”
line 9887: 
line 9888: “Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
line 9889: 
line 9890: “And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.
line 9891: 
line 9892: “She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there
line 9893: will probably be of some duration.”
line 9894: 
line 9895: Then after a short silence he continued:
line 9896: 
line 9897: “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
line 9898: last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
line 9899: 
line 9900: They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
line 9901: tea.
line 9902: 
line 9903: “This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an
line 9904: elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
line 9905: library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
line 9906: I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”
line 9907: 
line 9908: “I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should
line 9909: ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”
line 9910: 
line 9911: “_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
line 9912: for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
line 9913: you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
line 9914: my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
line 9915: absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
line 9916: And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
line 9917: spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”
line 9918: 
line 9919: Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
line 9920: 
line 9921: “Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
line 9922: girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
line 9923: them.”
line 9924: 
line 9925: 
line 9926: 
line 9927: Chapter 49
line 9928: 
line 9929: 
line 9930: Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
line 9931: together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
line 9932: coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
line 9933: mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
line 9934: when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,
line 9935: madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
line 9936: good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”
line 9937: 
line 9938: “What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
line 9939: 
line 9940: “Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don't you know
line 9941: there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
line 9942: this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”
line 9943: 
line 9944: Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
line 9945: ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
line 9946: library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
line 9947: seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
line 9948: butler, who said:
line 9949: 
line 9950: “If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
line 9951: little copse.”
line 9952: 
line 9953: Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
line 9954: more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
line 9955: pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
line 9956: 
line 9957: Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
line 9958: Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
line 9959: came up with him, and eagerly cried out:
line 9960: 
line 9961: “Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”
line 9962: 
line 9963: “Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”
line 9964: 
line 9965: “Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”
line 9966: 
line 9967: “What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
line 9968: his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”
line 9969: 
line 9970: Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
line 9971: 
line 9972: “Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is
line 9973: about.”
line 9974: 
line 9975: “Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
line 9976: 
line 9977: “MY DEAR BROTHER,
line 9978: 
line 9979: “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
line 9980: upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
line 9981: left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
line 9982: London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
line 9983: to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”
line 9984: 
line 9985: “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”
line 9986: 
line 9987: Elizabeth read on:
line 9988: 
line 9989: “I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
line 9990: was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
line 9991: engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
line 9992: not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
line 9993: to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
line 9994: pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
line 9995: my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
line 9996: during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
line 9997: which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
line 9998: as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
line 9999: express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
line 10000: will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
line 10001: circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
line 10002: The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
line 10003: will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
line 10004: settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
line 10005: will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
line 10006: the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
line 10007: Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
line 10008: smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
line 10009: Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
line 10010: fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
line 10011: best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
line 10012: you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
line 10013: anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,
line 10014: 
line 10015: “EDW. GARDINER.”
line 10016: 
line 10017: “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be
line 10018: possible that he will marry her?”
line 10019: 
line 10020: “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her
line 10021: sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”
line 10022: 
line 10023: “And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.
line 10024: 
line 10025: “No; but it must be done soon.”
line 10026: 
line 10027: Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
line 10028: wrote.
line 10029: 
line 10030: “Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
line 10031: Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”
line 10032: 
line 10033: “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
line 10034: yourself.”
line 10035: 
line 10036: “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
line 10037: 
line 10038: And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
line 10039: 
line 10040: “And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be
line 10041: complied with.”
line 10042: 
line 10043: “Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
line 10044: 
line 10045: “And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”
line 10046: 
line 10047: “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
line 10048: are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
line 10049: your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
line 10050: to pay him.”
line 10051: 
line 10052: “Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
line 10053: 
line 10054: “I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
line 10055: temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
line 10056: gone.”
line 10057: 
line 10058: “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
line 10059: before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
line 10060: it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
line 10061: distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”
line 10062: 
line 10063: “No,” said her father; “Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing
line 10064: less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
line 10065: in the very beginning of our relationship.”
line 10066: 
line 10067: “Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
line 10068: repaid?”
line 10069: 
line 10070: Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
line 10071: silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
line 10072: library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
line 10073: 
line 10074: “And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
line 10075: were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
line 10076: thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
line 10077: and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”
line 10078: 
line 10079: “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would
line 10080: not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
line 10081: uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
line 10082: thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
line 10083: of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
line 10084: pounds?”
line 10085: 
line 10086: “If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,” said
line 10087: Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
line 10088: exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
line 10089: not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
line 10090: be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
line 10091: protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
line 10092: years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
line 10093: actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
line 10094: she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
line 10095: first sees my aunt!”
line 10096: 
line 10097: “We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
line 10098: Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
line 10099: marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
line 10100: thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
line 10101: they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
line 10102: time make their past imprudence forgotten.”
line 10103: 
line 10104: “Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
line 10105: I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”
line 10106: 
line 10107: It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
line 10108: perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
line 10109: therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
line 10110: it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
line 10111: replied:
line 10112: 
line 10113: “Just as you please.”
line 10114: 
line 10115: “May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?”
line 10116: 
line 10117: “Take whatever you like, and get away.”
line 10118: 
line 10119: Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
line 10120: together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
line 10121: would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
line 10122: the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
line 10123: soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon
line 10124: married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
line 10125: exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
line 10126: had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
line 10127: would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
line 10128: felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
line 10129: 
line 10130: “My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will
line 10131: be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
line 10132: My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
line 10133: everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
line 10134: clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
line 10135: them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
line 10136: how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
line 10137: Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
line 10138: Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”
line 10139: 
line 10140: Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
line 10141: these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
line 10142: Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.
line 10143: 
line 10144: “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
line 10145: measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
line 10146: assist Mr. Wickham with money.”
line 10147: 
line 10148: “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
line 10149: her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
line 10150: must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
line 10151: ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
line 10152: In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
line 10153: it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
line 10154: such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and
line 10155: you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
line 10156: afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
line 10157: 
line 10158: She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
line 10159: cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
line 10160: not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
line 10161: father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,
line 10162: would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
line 10163: so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
line 10164: 
line 10165: “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
line 10166: good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
line 10167: on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
line 10168: An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
line 10169: anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
line 10170: heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
line 10171: all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
line 10172: 
line 10173: Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
line 10174: congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
line 10175: refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
line 10176: 
line 10177: Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
line 10178: no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
line 10179: looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
line 10180: be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
line 10181: feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
line 10182: gained.
line 10183: 
line 10184: 
line 10185: 
line 10186: Chapter 50
line 10187: 
line 10188: 
line 10189: Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
line 10190: instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
line 10191: the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
line 10192: him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
line 10193: respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
line 10194: of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
line 10195: prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
line 10196: her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
line 10197: 
line 10198: He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
line 10199: should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
line 10200: was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
line 10201: and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
line 10202: 
line 10203: When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
line 10204: useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
line 10205: in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
line 10206: and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
line 10207: successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
line 10208: Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
line 10209: would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
line 10210: too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
line 10211: husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
line 10212: income.
line 10213: 
line 10214: Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
line 10215: the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
line 10216: latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
line 10217: regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
line 10218: could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
line 10219: terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
line 10220: though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
line 10221: approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
line 10222: engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
line 10223: that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
line 10224: be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
line 10225: arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
line 10226: hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
line 10227: allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
line 10228: through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within
line 10229: that sum.
line 10230: 
line 10231: That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
line 10232: another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
line 10233: little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
line 10234: of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
line 10235: naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
line 10236: dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
line 10237: in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
line 10238: was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
line 10239: message to her.
line 10240: 
line 10241: The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
line 10242: speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
line 10243: philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
line 10244: of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
line 10245: happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
line 10246: farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
line 10247: good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
line 10248: all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
line 10249: in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
line 10250: was considered certain.
line 10251: 
line 10252: It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
line 10253: happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
line 10254: spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
line 10255: triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
line 10256: of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
line 10257: accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
line 10258: attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
line 10259: servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
line 10260: proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
line 10261: what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
line 10262: importance.
line 10263: 
line 10264: “Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the
line 10265: great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
line 10266: too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
line 10267: Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
line 10268: 
line 10269: Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
line 10270: servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.
line 10271: Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
line 10272: daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
line 10273: neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
line 10274: impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”
line 10275: 
line 10276: A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
line 10277: soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
line 10278: that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
line 10279: daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
line 10280: affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
line 10281: it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
line 10282: resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
line 10283: marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
line 10284: possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
line 10285: clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
line 10286: shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
line 10287: took place.
line 10288: 
line 10289: Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
line 10290: the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
line 10291: her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
line 10292: proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
line 10293: unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
line 10294: spot.
line 10295: 
line 10296: She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
line 10297: few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
line 10298: but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
line 10299: frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
line 10300: of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
line 10301: there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
line 10302: concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
line 10303: Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
line 10304: objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
line 10305: nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.
line 10306: 
line 10307: From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
line 10308: wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
line 10309: feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
line 10310: blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
line 10311: hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
line 10312: longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
line 10313: seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
line 10314: she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
line 10315: should meet.
line 10316: 
line 10317: What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
line 10318: proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
line 10319: have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
line 10320: doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
line 10321: there must be a triumph.
line 10322: 
line 10323: She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
line 10324: disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
line 10325: temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
line 10326: was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
line 10327: and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
line 10328: and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
line 10329: must have received benefit of greater importance.
line 10330: 
line 10331: But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
line 10332: connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
line 10333: precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
line 10334: family.
line 10335: 
line 10336: How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
line 10337: she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
line 10338: belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
line 10339: were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
line 10340: 
line 10341:                           * * * * *
line 10342: 
line 10343: Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
line 10344: acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
line 10345: promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
line 10346: that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
line 10347: purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
line 10348: on quitting the militia.
line 10349: 
line 10350: “It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as
line 10351: his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
line 10352: considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
line 10353: his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into
line 10354: the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
line 10355: are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
line 10356: ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
line 10357: is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
line 10358: promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
line 10359: have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
line 10360: written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
line 10361: and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
line 10362: in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
line 10363: have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
line 10364: similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
line 10365: a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
line 10366: hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
line 10367: and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
line 10368: unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
line 10369: Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
line 10370: leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
line 10371: you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,
line 10372: 
line 10373: “E. GARDINER.”
line 10374: 
line 10375: Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
line 10376: from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
line 10377: was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,
line 10378: just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
line 10379: for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
line 10380: Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
line 10381: pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
line 10382: with everybody, and had so many favourites.
line 10383: 
line 10384: “She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
line 10385: to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
line 10386: likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
line 10387: regiment.”
line 10388: 
line 10389: His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
line 10390: admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
line 10391: received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
line 10392: who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
line 10393: consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
line 10394: urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
line 10395: and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
line 10396: prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
line 10397: mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
line 10398: her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
line 10399: North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
line 10400: his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
line 10401: the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
line 10402: surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
line 10403: had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
line 10404: have been the last object of her wishes.
line 10405: 
line 10406: 
line 10407: 
line 10408: Chapter 51
line 10409: 
line 10410: 
line 10411: Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
line 10412: probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
line 10413: meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
line 10414: arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
line 10415: who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
line 10416: been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
line 10417: must endure.
line 10418: 
line 10419: They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
line 10420: them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
line 10421: the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
line 10422: anxious, uneasy.
line 10423: 
line 10424: Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
line 10425: she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
line 10426: welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
line 10427: to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
line 10428: alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
line 10429: 
line 10430: Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
line 10431: so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
line 10432: opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
line 10433: enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
line 10434: was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
line 10435: and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
line 10436: congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
line 10437: round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
line 10438: observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
line 10439: there.
line 10440: 
line 10441: Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
line 10442: were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
line 10443: exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
line 10444: claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
line 10445: not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
line 10446: resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
line 10447: of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
line 10448: two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
line 10449: 
line 10450: There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
line 10451: of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
line 10452: Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
line 10453: with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
line 10454: replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
line 10455: world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
line 10456: voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
line 10457: the world.
line 10458: 
line 10459: “Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;
line 10460: it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
line 10461: enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
line 10462: I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
line 10463: thought it would be very good fun if I was.”
line 10464: 
line 10465: Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
line 10466: expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
line 10467: which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the
line 10468: people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
line 10469: and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
line 10470: should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
line 10471: off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
line 10472: he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”
line 10473: 
line 10474: Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
line 10475: and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
line 10476: the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
line 10477: anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say
line 10478: to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
line 10479: lower, because I am a married woman.”
line 10480: 
line 10481: It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
line 10482: from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
line 10483: spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
line 10484: all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”
line 10485:  by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
line 10486: ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
line 10487: 
line 10488: “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
line 10489: room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
line 10490: am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
line 10491: my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
line 10492: husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”
line 10493: 
line 10494: “Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't
line 10495: at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
line 10496: 
line 10497: “Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
line 10498: things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
line 10499: shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
line 10500: balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”
line 10501: 
line 10502: “I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
line 10503: 
line 10504: “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
line 10505: behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
line 10506: winter is over.”
line 10507: 
line 10508: “I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not
line 10509: particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
line 10510: 
line 10511: Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
line 10512: had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
line 10513: his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
line 10514: 
line 10515: No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
line 10516: she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
line 10517: having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
line 10518: all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
line 10519: think, than such as did not.
line 10520: 
line 10521: Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
line 10522: to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her
line 10523: present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
line 10524: their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
line 10525: than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
line 10526: for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
line 10527: that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
line 10528: if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
line 10529: of having a companion.
line 10530: 
line 10531: Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
line 10532: occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
line 10533: thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
line 10534: the first of September, than any body else in the country.
line 10535: 
line 10536: One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
line 10537: elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:
line 10538: 
line 10539: “Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
line 10540: were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
line 10541: curious to hear how it was managed?”
line 10542: 
line 10543: “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said
line 10544: on the subject.”
line 10545: 
line 10546: “La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
line 10547: married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
line 10548: that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
line 10549: o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
line 10550: were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
line 10551: such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
line 10552: put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
line 10553: my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
line 10554: if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
line 10555: ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
line 10556: to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”
line 10557: 
line 10558: “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
line 10559: be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
line 10560: were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
line 10561: me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
line 10562: fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
line 10563: rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
line 10564: just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
line 10565: business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
line 10566: they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
line 10567: did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
line 10568: were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
line 10569: came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,
line 10570: I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
line 10571: wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”
line 10572: 
line 10573: “Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
line 10574: 
line 10575: “Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
line 10576: me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
line 10577: them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”
line 10578: 
line 10579: “If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
line 10580: subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”
line 10581: 
line 10582: “Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
line 10583: ask you no questions.”
line 10584: 
line 10585: “Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you
line 10586: all, and then Wickham would be angry.”
line 10587: 
line 10588: On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
line 10589: power, by running away.
line 10590: 
line 10591: But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
line 10592: it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
line 10593: her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
line 10594: where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
line 10595: Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
line 10596: brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
line 10597: placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
line 10598: could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
line 10599: wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
line 10600: Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
line 10601: intended.
line 10602: 
line 10603: “You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be
line 10604: to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
line 10605: speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
line 10606: a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
line 10607: for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
line 10608: to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
line 10609: ignorance.”
line 10610: 
line 10611: “Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished
line 10612: the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
line 10613: manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
line 10614: out.”
line 10615: 
line 10616: Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
line 10617: Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
line 10618: of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
line 10619: satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.
line 10620: 
line 10621: 
line 10622: 
line 10623: Chapter 52
line 10624: 
line 10625: 
line 10626: Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
line 10627: soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
line 10628: than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
line 10629: be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
line 10630: be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
line 10631: contain a denial.
line 10632: 
line 10633: “Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
line 10634: 
line 10635: “MY DEAR NIECE,
line 10636: 
line 10637: “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
line 10638: to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
line 10639: what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
line 10640: application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,
line 10641: however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
line 10642: inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
line 10643: understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
line 10644: as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
line 10645: would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
line 10646: innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
line 10647: 
line 10648: “On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
line 10649: unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
line 10650: hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
line 10651: dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
line 10652: Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
line 10653: and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
line 10654: Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
line 10655: after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
line 10656: them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
line 10657: himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to
line 10658: make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
line 10659: in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
line 10660: confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
line 10661: actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
line 10662: called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
line 10663: an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
line 10664: motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
line 10665: in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
line 10666: direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
line 10667: of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.
line 10668: 
line 10669: “There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
line 10670: governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
line 10671: of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
line 10672: house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
line 10673: lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
line 10674: Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
line 10675: town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
line 10676: wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
line 10677: corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
line 10678: Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
line 10679: she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
line 10680: their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
line 10681: wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
line 10682: afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
line 10683: acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
line 10684: situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
line 10685: on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
line 10686: he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
line 10687: for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
line 10688: of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
line 10689: other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
line 10690: it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
line 10691: in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
line 10692: been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
line 10693: on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
line 10694: scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her
line 10695: own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
line 10696: to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
line 10697: must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
line 10698: nothing to live on.
line 10699: 
line 10700: “Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
line 10701: Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
line 10702: to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
line 10703: marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
line 10704: cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
line 10705: some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
line 10706: to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
line 10707: 
line 10708: “They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
line 10709: course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
line 10710: reasonable.
line 10711: 
line 10712: “Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to
line 10713: make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
line 10714: street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
line 10715: seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
line 10716: still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
line 10717: your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
line 10718: uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
line 10719: departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
line 10720: day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
line 10721: 
line 10722: “On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
line 10723: and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
line 10724: 
line 10725: “They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
line 10726: settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
line 10727: Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
line 10728: obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
line 10729: accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
line 10730: Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
line 10731: I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
line 10732: uncle would most readily have settled the whole.
line 10733: 
line 10734: “They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
line 10735: the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
line 10736: was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
line 10737: niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
line 10738: which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
line 10739: this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
line 10740: that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
line 10741: it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
line 10742: at most.
line 10743: 
line 10744: “You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
line 10745: people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
line 10746: more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
line 10747: settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
line 10748: this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
line 10749: was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
line 10750: Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
line 10751: had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
line 10752: in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,
line 10753: can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
line 10754: my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
line 10755: never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
line 10756: interest_ in the affair.
line 10757: 
line 10758: “When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
line 10759: were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
line 10760: London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
line 10761: then to receive the last finish.
line 10762: 
line 10763: “I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
line 10764: you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
line 10765: afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
line 10766: admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
line 10767: knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
line 10768: satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
line 10769: perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
line 10770: home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
line 10771: you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
line 10772: serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
line 10773: done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
line 10774: heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
line 10775: sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
line 10776: Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.
line 10777: 
line 10778: “Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
line 10779: attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
line 10780: town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
line 10781: dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
line 10782: enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
line 10783: in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
line 10784: understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
line 10785: more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
line 10786: him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
line 10787: slyness seems the fashion.
line 10788: 
line 10789: “Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
line 10790: punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
line 10791: till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
line 10792: pair of ponies, would be the very thing.
line 10793: 
line 10794: “But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
line 10795: hour.
line 10796: 
line 10797: “Yours, very sincerely,
line 10798: 
line 10799: “M. GARDINER.”
line 10800: 
line 10801: The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
line 10802: in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
line 10803: greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
line 10804: produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
line 10805: match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
line 10806: great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
line 10807: pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
line 10808: He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
line 10809: the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
line 10810: supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
line 10811: despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
line 10812: with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
line 10813: avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
line 10814: done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
line 10815: heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
line 10816: checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
line 10817: was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
line 10818: a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
line 10819: natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
line 10820: of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
line 10821: to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
line 10822: given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
line 10823: stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
line 10824: wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
line 10825: though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
line 10826: could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
line 10827: his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
line 10828: concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
line 10829: under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
line 10830: owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
line 10831: how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
line 10832: encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
line 10833: herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
line 10834: of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
line 10835: She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It
line 10836: was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
line 10837: pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
line 10838: and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
line 10839: between Mr. Darcy and herself.
line 10840: 
line 10841: She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
line 10842: approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
line 10843: overtaken by Wickham.
line 10844: 
line 10845: “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
line 10846: as he joined her.
line 10847: 
line 10848: “You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
line 10849: that the interruption must be unwelcome.”
line 10850: 
line 10851: “I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
line 10852: now we are better.”
line 10853: 
line 10854: “True. Are the others coming out?”
line 10855: 
line 10856: “I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
line 10857: Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
line 10858: you have actually seen Pemberley.”
line 10859: 
line 10860: She replied in the affirmative.
line 10861: 
line 10862: “I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
line 10863: for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
line 10864: old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
line 10865: me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”
line 10866: 
line 10867: “Yes, she did.”
line 10868: 
line 10869: “And what did she say?”
line 10870: 
line 10871: “That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
line 10872: out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
line 10873: misrepresented.”
line 10874: 
line 10875: “Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
line 10876: silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:
line 10877: 
line 10878: “I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
line 10879: several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”
line 10880: 
line 10881: “Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said
line 10882: Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this
line 10883: time of year.”
line 10884: 
line 10885: “Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
line 10886: understood from the Gardiners that you had.”
line 10887: 
line 10888: “Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
line 10889: 
line 10890: “And do you like her?”
line 10891: 
line 10892: “Very much.”
line 10893: 
line 10894: “I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
line 10895: or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
line 10896: you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”
line 10897: 
line 10898: “I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
line 10899: 
line 10900: “Did you go by the village of Kympton?”
line 10901: 
line 10902: “I do not recollect that we did.”
line 10903: 
line 10904: “I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
line 10905: most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
line 10906: me in every respect.”
line 10907: 
line 10908: “How should you have liked making sermons?”
line 10909: 
line 10910: “Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
line 10911: and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
line 10912: repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
line 10913: quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
line 10914: of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
line 10915: circumstance, when you were in Kent?”
line 10916: 
line 10917: “I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
line 10918: left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
line 10919: 
line 10920: “You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
line 10921: first, you may remember.”
line 10922: 
line 10923: “I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
line 10924: so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
line 10925: declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
line 10926: had been compromised accordingly.”
line 10927: 
line 10928: “You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
line 10929: what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
line 10930: 
line 10931: They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
line 10932: to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
line 10933: she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:
line 10934: 
line 10935: “Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
line 10936: us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
line 10937: mind.”
line 10938: 
line 10939: She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
line 10940: he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
line 10941: 
line 10942: 
line 10943: 
line 10944: Chapter 53
line 10945: 
line 10946: 
line 10947: Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
line 10948: never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
line 10949: by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
line 10950: had said enough to keep him quiet.
line 10951: 
line 10952: The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
line 10953: forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
line 10954: entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
line 10955: continue at least a twelvemonth.
line 10956: 
line 10957: “Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
line 10958: 
line 10959: “Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”
line 10960: 
line 10961: “Write to me very often, my dear.”
line 10962: 
line 10963: “As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
line 10964: writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
line 10965: do.”
line 10966: 
line 10967: Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He
line 10968: smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
line 10969: 
line 10970: “He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
line 10971: the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
line 10972: us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
line 10973: himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”
line 10974: 
line 10975: The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
line 10976: 
line 10977: “I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
line 10978: one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”
line 10979: 
line 10980: “This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
line 10981: Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
line 10982: single.”
line 10983: 
line 10984: “It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
line 10985: but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
line 10986: that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
line 10987: 
line 10988: But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
line 10989: relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
line 10990: article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
line 10991: at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
line 10992: master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
line 10993: weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
line 10994: smiled and shook her head by turns.
line 10995: 
line 10996: “Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.
line 10997: Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not
line 10998: that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
line 10999: sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
line 11000: to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
line 11001: But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
line 11002: mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”
line 11003: 
line 11004: “You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in
line 11005: Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
line 11006: to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
line 11007: comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
line 11008: going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
line 11009: Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
line 11010: 
line 11011: Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
line 11012: colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
line 11013: Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:
line 11014: 
line 11015: “I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
line 11016: report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from
line 11017: any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
line 11018: I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
line 11019: me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
line 11020: alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
line 11021: _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.”
line 11022: 
line 11023: Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
line 11024: Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
line 11025: other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
line 11026: to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
line 11027: there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
line 11028: without it.
line 11029: 
line 11030: “Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot
line 11031: come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
line 11032: speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”
line 11033: 
line 11034: In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
line 11035: feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
line 11036: perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
line 11037: more unequal, than she had often seen them.
line 11038: 
line 11039: The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
line 11040: about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
line 11041: 
line 11042: “As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
line 11043: will wait on him of course.”
line 11044: 
line 11045: “No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
line 11046: went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
line 11047: nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.”
line 11048: 
line 11049: His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
line 11050: would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
line 11051: Netherfield.
line 11052: 
line 11053: “'Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,
line 11054: let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
line 11055: in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
line 11056: again.”
line 11057: 
line 11058: “Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
line 11059: on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I
line 11060: am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
line 11061: make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
line 11062: him.”
line 11063: 
line 11064: Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
line 11065: husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
line 11066: neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
line 11067: _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--
line 11068: 
line 11069: “I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It
line 11070: would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
line 11071: hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
line 11072: but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
line 11073: says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
line 11074: 
line 11075: “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it
line 11076: is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
line 11077: of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
line 11078: always so much.”
line 11079: 
line 11080: Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
line 11081: contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
line 11082: and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
line 11083: the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
line 11084: hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
line 11085: arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
line 11086: enter the paddock and ride towards the house.
line 11087: 
line 11088: Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
line 11089: kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
line 11090: to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
line 11091: again by her sister.
line 11092: 
line 11093: “There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”
line 11094: 
line 11095: “Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
line 11096: know.”
line 11097: 
line 11098: “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
line 11099: him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.”
line 11100: 
line 11101: “Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
line 11102: Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
line 11103: say that I hate the very sight of him.”
line 11104: 
line 11105: Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
line 11106: of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
line 11107: which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
line 11108: after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
line 11109: enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
line 11110: mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
line 11111: civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
line 11112: of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
line 11113: suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
line 11114: Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
line 11115: To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
line 11116: and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
line 11117: information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
line 11118: for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
line 11119: interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
line 11120: what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
line 11121: coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
line 11122: was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
line 11123: behaviour in Derbyshire.
line 11124: 
line 11125: The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
line 11126: minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
line 11127: her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
line 11128: wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
line 11129: 
line 11130: “Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
line 11131: enough for expectation.”
line 11132: 
line 11133: She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
line 11134: lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
line 11135: her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
line 11136: paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
line 11137: gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
line 11138: tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
line 11139: symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
line 11140: 
line 11141: Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
line 11142: again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
line 11143: had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
line 11144: she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
line 11145: she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
line 11146: presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
line 11147: not an improbable, conjecture.
line 11148: 
line 11149: Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
line 11150: saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
line 11151: Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
line 11152: especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
line 11153: her curtsey and address to his friend.
line 11154: 
line 11155: Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
line 11156: the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
line 11157: was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
line 11158: applied.
line 11159: 
line 11160: Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
line 11161: which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
line 11162: was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
line 11163: it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
line 11164: when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
line 11165: bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
line 11166: the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
line 11167: found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
line 11168: the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
line 11169: they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
line 11170: with herself for being so.
line 11171: 
line 11172: “Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”
line 11173: 
line 11174: She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
line 11175: him she had hardly courage to speak.
line 11176: 
line 11177: She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
line 11178: 
line 11179: “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.
line 11180: 
line 11181: He readily agreed to it.
line 11182: 
line 11183: “I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
line 11184: you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
line 11185: it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
line 11186: since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
line 11187: own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
line 11188: seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
line 11189: though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,
line 11190: George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
line 11191: syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
line 11192: It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
line 11193: make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”
line 11194: 
line 11195: Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
line 11196: dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
line 11197: not tell.
line 11198: 
line 11199: “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
line 11200:  continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
line 11201: hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
line 11202: Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
line 11203: I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
line 11204: heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
line 11205: regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
line 11206: many as he deserves.”
line 11207: 
line 11208: Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
line 11209: misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
line 11210: however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
line 11211: done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
line 11212: the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
line 11213: 
line 11214: “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,
line 11215: “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
line 11216: Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
line 11217: will save all the best of the covies for you.”
line 11218: 
line 11219: Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
line 11220: attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
line 11221: flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
line 11222: hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
line 11223: that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
line 11224: moments of such painful confusion.
line 11225: 
line 11226: “The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to
line 11227: be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
line 11228: that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
line 11229: one or the other again!”
line 11230: 
line 11231: Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
line 11232: compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
line 11233: how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
line 11234: former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
line 11235: but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
line 11236: found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
line 11237: as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
line 11238: difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
line 11239: that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
line 11240: that she did not always know when she was silent.
line 11241: 
line 11242: When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
line 11243: intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
line 11244: Longbourn in a few days time.
line 11245: 
line 11246: “You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when
line 11247: you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
line 11248: us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
line 11249: you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
line 11250: your engagement.”
line 11251: 
line 11252: Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
line 11253: his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
line 11254: 
line 11255: Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
line 11256: there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
line 11257: not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
line 11258: on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
line 11259: of one who had ten thousand a year.
line 11260: 
line 11261: 
line 11262: 
line 11263: Chapter 54
line 11264: 
line 11265: 
line 11266: As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
line 11267: or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
line 11268: must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.
line 11269: 
line 11270: “Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
line 11271: “did he come at all?”
line 11272: 
line 11273: She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
line 11274: 
line 11275: “He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
line 11276: he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
line 11277: he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
line 11278: think no more about him.”
line 11279: 
line 11280: Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
line 11281: of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
line 11282: better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
line 11283: 
line 11284: “Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
line 11285: easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
line 11286: his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
line 11287: seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
line 11288: acquaintance.”
line 11289: 
line 11290: “Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane,
line 11291: take care.”
line 11292: 
line 11293: “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”
line 11294: 
line 11295: “I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
line 11296: you as ever.”
line 11297: 
line 11298:                           * * * * *
line 11299: 
line 11300: They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
line 11301: the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
line 11302: humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
line 11303: revived.
line 11304: 
line 11305: On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
line 11306: who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
line 11307: as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
line 11308: dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
line 11309: the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
line 11310: her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
line 11311: to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
line 11312: hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
line 11313: decided. He placed himself by her.
line 11314: 
line 11315: Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
line 11316: He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
line 11317: Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
line 11318: likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
line 11319: alarm.
line 11320: 
line 11321: His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
line 11322: admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
line 11323: Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
line 11324: own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
line 11325: consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
line 11326: gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
line 11327: no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
line 11328: could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
line 11329: such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
line 11330: advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
line 11331: she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
line 11332: cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,
line 11333: made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
line 11334: and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
line 11335: him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
line 11336: family.
line 11337: 
line 11338: She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
line 11339: bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
line 11340: without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
line 11341: the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
line 11342: and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
line 11343: gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
line 11344: uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
line 11345: her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
line 11346: 
line 11347: “If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for
line 11348: ever.”
line 11349: 
line 11350: The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
line 11351: answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
line 11352: where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
line 11353: in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
line 11354: which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
line 11355: the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:
line 11356: 
line 11357: “The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
line 11358: do we?”
line 11359: 
line 11360: Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
line 11361: her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
line 11362: to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
line 11363: being so silly!
line 11364: 
line 11365: “A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
line 11366: expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
line 11367: protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
line 11368: There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”
line 11369: 
line 11370: She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
line 11371: himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:
line 11372: 
line 11373: “Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
line 11374: 
line 11375: “Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”
line 11376: 
line 11377: “And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”
line 11378: 
line 11379: “Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
line 11380: these three weeks.”
line 11381: 
line 11382: She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
line 11383: with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
line 11384: some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
line 11385: to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
line 11386: 
line 11387: When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
line 11388: all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
line 11389: when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
line 11390: mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
line 11391: with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
line 11392: They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
line 11393: nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
line 11394: of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
line 11395: 
line 11396: Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
line 11397: supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
line 11398: others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
line 11399: 
line 11400: “Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What
line 11401: say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
line 11402: I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
line 11403: venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
line 11404: fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
line 11405: Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
line 11406: were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
line 11407: cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
line 11408: beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
line 11409: what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
line 11410: at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
line 11411: a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
line 11412: and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
line 11413: 
line 11414: Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
line 11415: Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
line 11416: last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
line 11417: humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
line 11418: not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
line 11419: 
line 11420: “It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The
line 11421: party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
line 11422: may often meet again.”
line 11423: 
line 11424: Elizabeth smiled.
line 11425: 
line 11426: “Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
line 11427: I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
line 11428: agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
line 11429: perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
line 11430: any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
line 11431: with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
line 11432: pleasing, than any other man.”
line 11433: 
line 11434: “You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
line 11435: are provoking me to it every moment.”
line 11436: 
line 11437: “How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”
line 11438: 
line 11439: “And how impossible in others!”
line 11440: 
line 11441: “But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
line 11442: acknowledge?”
line 11443: 
line 11444: “That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
line 11445: instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
line 11446: me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”
line 11447: 
line 11448: 
line 11449: 
line 11450: Chapter 55
line 11451: 
line 11452: 
line 11453: A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
line 11454: friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
line 11455: ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
line 11456: good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
line 11457: expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
line 11458: 
line 11459: “Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
line 11460: 
line 11461: He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
line 11462: give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
line 11463: 
line 11464: “Can you come to-morrow?”
line 11465: 
line 11466: Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
line 11467: accepted with alacrity.
line 11468: 
line 11469: He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
line 11470: dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
line 11471: gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:
line 11472: 
line 11473: “My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
line 11474: come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
line 11475: Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
line 11476: Lizzy's hair.”
line 11477: 
line 11478: “We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
line 11479: forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”
line 11480: 
line 11481: “Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
line 11482: Where is your sash, my dear?”
line 11483: 
line 11484: But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
line 11485: without one of her sisters.
line 11486: 
line 11487: The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
line 11488: evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
line 11489: custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
line 11490: the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
line 11491: Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
line 11492: impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
line 11493: Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do
line 11494: you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”
line 11495: 
line 11496: “Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
line 11497: five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
line 11498: suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to
line 11499: speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
line 11500: at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
line 11501: entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
line 11502: Bennet half-opened the door and called out:
line 11503: 
line 11504: “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
line 11505: 
line 11506: Elizabeth was forced to go.
line 11507: 
line 11508: “We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as
line 11509: soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
line 11510: my dressing-room.”
line 11511: 
line 11512: Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
line 11513: quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
line 11514: into the drawing-room.
line 11515: 
line 11516: Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
line 11517: thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
line 11518: ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
line 11519: evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
line 11520: mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
line 11521: of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
line 11522: 
line 11523: He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
line 11524: away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
line 11525: Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
line 11526: 
line 11527: After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
line 11528: between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
line 11529: the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
line 11530: returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
line 11531: persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
line 11532: concurrence.
line 11533: 
line 11534: Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
line 11535: the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
line 11536: agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
line 11537: or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
line 11538: silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
line 11539: other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
line 11540: and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
line 11541: every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
line 11542: to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
line 11543: for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
line 11544: wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
line 11545: 
line 11546: But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
line 11547: saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
line 11548: had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
line 11549: sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
line 11550: earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
line 11551: both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
line 11552: have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
line 11553: thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
line 11554: Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
line 11555: well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
line 11556: words to her sister, ran out of the room.
line 11557: 
line 11558: Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
line 11559: pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
line 11560: emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
line 11561: 
line 11562: “'Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
line 11563: why is not everybody as happy?”
line 11564: 
line 11565: Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
line 11566: a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
line 11567: kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
line 11568: allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
line 11569: said for the present.
line 11570: 
line 11571: “I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any
line 11572: account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
line 11573: from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
line 11574: know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
line 11575: family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”
line 11576: 
line 11577: She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
line 11578: card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
line 11579: 
line 11580: Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
line 11581: with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
line 11582: previous months of suspense and vexation.
line 11583: 
line 11584: “And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend's anxious
line 11585: circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
line 11586: happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”
line 11587: 
line 11588: In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
line 11589: father had been short and to the purpose.
line 11590: 
line 11591: “Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
line 11592: 
line 11593: “With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”
line 11594: 
line 11595: He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
line 11596: and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
line 11597: her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
line 11598: great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
line 11599: to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
line 11600: and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
line 11601: expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
line 11602: basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
line 11603: Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
line 11604: himself.
line 11605: 
line 11606: It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
line 11607: Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
line 11608: made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
line 11609: her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
line 11610: speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
line 11611: though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
line 11612: Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
line 11613: how really happy he was.
line 11614: 
line 11615: Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
line 11616: visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
line 11617: turned to his daughter, and said:
line 11618: 
line 11619: “Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”
line 11620: 
line 11621: Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
line 11622: goodness.
line 11623: 
line 11624: “You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
line 11625: thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
line 11626: doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
line 11627: each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
line 11628: easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
line 11629: always exceed your income.”
line 11630: 
line 11631: “I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
line 11632: unpardonable in me.”
line 11633: 
line 11634: “Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
line 11635: talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
line 11636: more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
line 11637: happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
line 11638: would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
line 11639: be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
line 11640: he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
line 11641: that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
line 11642: ever was seen!”
line 11643: 
line 11644: Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
line 11645: favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
line 11646: sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
line 11647: which she might in future be able to dispense.
line 11648: 
line 11649: Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
line 11650: begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
line 11651: 
line 11652: Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
line 11653: coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
line 11654: supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
line 11655: detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
line 11656: obliged to accept.
line 11657: 
line 11658: Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
line 11659: while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
line 11660: but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
line 11661: of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
line 11662: always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
line 11663: her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
line 11664: relief.
line 11665: 
line 11666: “He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
line 11667: was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
line 11668: it possible.”
line 11669: 
line 11670: “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for
line 11671: it?”
line 11672: 
line 11673: “It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to
line 11674: his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
line 11675: chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
line 11676: as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
line 11677: learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
line 11678: can never be what we once were to each other.”
line 11679: 
line 11680: “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever
line 11681: heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
line 11682: the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.”
line 11683: 
line 11684: “Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
line 11685: he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
line 11686: indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”
line 11687: 
line 11688: “He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
line 11689: modesty.”
line 11690: 
line 11691: This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
line 11692: the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
line 11693: to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
line 11694: though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
line 11695: knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
line 11696: 
line 11697: “I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
line 11698: Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
line 11699: above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
line 11700: such another man for you!”
line 11701: 
line 11702: “If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
line 11703: you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
line 11704: happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
line 11705: good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
line 11706: 
line 11707: The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
line 11708: secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
line 11709: and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
line 11710: neighbours in Meryton.
line 11711: 
line 11712: The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
line 11713: world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
line 11714: they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
line 11715: 
line 11716: 
line 11717: 
line 11718: Chapter 56
line 11719: 
line 11720: 
line 11721: One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
line 11722: formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
line 11723: dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
line 11724: sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
line 11725: the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
line 11726: equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
line 11727: were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
line 11728: preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
line 11729: somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
line 11730: the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
line 11731: shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
line 11732: continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
line 11733: open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
line 11734: 
line 11735: They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
line 11736: astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
line 11737: Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
line 11738: inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
line 11739: 
line 11740: She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
line 11741: other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
line 11742: head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
line 11743: name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
line 11744: introduction had been made.
line 11745: 
line 11746: Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
line 11747: high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
line 11748: for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
line 11749: 
line 11750: “I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
line 11751: mother.”
line 11752: 
line 11753: Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
line 11754: 
line 11755: “And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”
line 11756: 
line 11757: “Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
line 11758: “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
line 11759: and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
line 11760: who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”
line 11761: 
line 11762: “You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short
line 11763: silence.
line 11764: 
line 11765: “It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
line 11766: assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.”
line 11767: 
line 11768: “This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
line 11769: summer; the windows are full west.”
line 11770: 
line 11771: Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
line 11772: added:
line 11773: 
line 11774: “May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
line 11775: Mrs. Collins well.”
line 11776: 
line 11777: “Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”
line 11778: 
line 11779: Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
line 11780: Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
line 11781: letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
line 11782: 
line 11783: Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
line 11784: refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
line 11785: declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
line 11786: 
line 11787: “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
line 11788: on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
line 11789: will favour me with your company.”
line 11790: 
line 11791: “Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
line 11792: different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
line 11793: 
line 11794: Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
line 11795: attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
line 11796: hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
line 11797: drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
line 11798: looking rooms, walked on.
line 11799: 
line 11800: Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
line 11801: waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
line 11802: that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
line 11803: conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
line 11804: disagreeable.
line 11805: 
line 11806: “How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
line 11807: her face.
line 11808: 
line 11809: As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
line 11810: manner:--
line 11811: 
line 11812: “You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
line 11813: journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
line 11814: come.”
line 11815: 
line 11816: Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
line 11817: 
line 11818: “Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
line 11819: for the honour of seeing you here.”
line 11820: 
line 11821: “Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
line 11822: know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
line 11823: choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
line 11824: celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
line 11825: moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
line 11826: alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
line 11827: sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
line 11828: you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
line 11829: afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
line 11830: _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
line 11831: so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
line 11832: on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
line 11833: you.”
line 11834: 
line 11835: “If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
line 11836: with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
line 11837: so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”
line 11838: 
line 11839: “At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
line 11840: 
line 11841: “Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
line 11842: coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
line 11843: is in existence.”
line 11844: 
line 11845: “If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
line 11846: industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
line 11847: report is spread abroad?”
line 11848: 
line 11849: “I never heard that it was.”
line 11850: 
line 11851: “And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”
line 11852: 
line 11853: “I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
line 11854: ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”
line 11855: 
line 11856: “This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
line 11857: he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
line 11858: 
line 11859: “Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
line 11860: 
line 11861: “It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
line 11862: reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
line 11863: have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
line 11864: may have drawn him in.”
line 11865: 
line 11866: “If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”
line 11867: 
line 11868: “Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
line 11869: language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
line 11870: and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
line 11871: 
line 11872: “But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
line 11873: ever induce me to be explicit.”
line 11874: 
line 11875: “Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
line 11876: presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
line 11877: engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”
line 11878: 
line 11879: “Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
line 11880: make an offer to me.”
line 11881: 
line 11882: Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:
line 11883: 
line 11884: “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
line 11885: they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
line 11886: _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
line 11887: the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
line 11888: be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
line 11889: inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
line 11890: the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
line 11891: tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
line 11892: propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
line 11893: hours he was destined for his cousin?”
line 11894: 
line 11895: “Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
line 11896: no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
line 11897: be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
line 11898: marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
line 11899: marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
line 11900: by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
line 11901: another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”
line 11902: 
line 11903: “Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
line 11904: Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
line 11905: friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
line 11906: be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
line 11907: Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
line 11908: by any of us.”
line 11909: 
line 11910: “These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
line 11911: Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
line 11912: attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
line 11913: to repine.”
line 11914: 
line 11915: “Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
line 11916: for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
line 11917: score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
line 11918: here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
line 11919: I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's
line 11920: whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
line 11921: 
line 11922: “_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
line 11923: but it will have no effect on me.”
line 11924: 
line 11925: “I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
line 11926: nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
line 11927: side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
line 11928: honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
line 11929: both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
line 11930: every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
line 11931: The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
line 11932: or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
line 11933: were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
line 11934: which you have been brought up.”
line 11935: 
line 11936: “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
line 11937: sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
line 11938: equal.”
line 11939: 
line 11940: “True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?
line 11941: Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
line 11942: condition.”
line 11943: 
line 11944: “Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
line 11945: not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
line 11946: 
line 11947: “Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”
line 11948: 
line 11949: Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
line 11950: Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
line 11951: moment's deliberation:
line 11952: 
line 11953: “I am not.”
line 11954: 
line 11955: Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
line 11956: 
line 11957: “And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”
line 11958: 
line 11959: “I will make no promise of the kind.”
line 11960: 
line 11961: “Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
line 11962: reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
line 11963: I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
line 11964: assurance I require.”
line 11965: 
line 11966: “And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
line 11967: anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
line 11968: your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
line 11969: marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
line 11970: my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
line 11971: Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
line 11972: supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
line 11973: application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
line 11974: you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
line 11975: nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
line 11976: but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
line 11977: therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”
line 11978: 
line 11979: “Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
line 11980: objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
line 11981: no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
line 11982: elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a
line 11983: patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
line 11984: such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
line 11985: late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
line 11986: you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”
line 11987: 
line 11988: “You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
line 11989: “You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
line 11990: the house.”
line 11991: 
line 11992: And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
line 11993: back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.
line 11994: 
line 11995: “You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
line 11996: Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
line 11997: must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
line 11998: 
line 11999: “Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”
line 12000: 
line 12001: “You are then resolved to have him?”
line 12002: 
line 12003: “I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
line 12004: which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
line 12005: reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
line 12006: 
line 12007: “It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
line 12008: claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
line 12009: the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
line 12010: 
line 12011: “Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any
line 12012: possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
line 12013: would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
line 12014: resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
line 12015: _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
line 12016: concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
line 12017: the scorn.”
line 12018: 
line 12019: “And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
line 12020: I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
line 12021: ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
line 12022: reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”
line 12023: 
line 12024: In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
line 12025: the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave
line 12026: of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
line 12027: no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”
line 12028: 
line 12029: Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
line 12030: ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
line 12031: heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
line 12032: impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
line 12033: Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
line 12034: 
line 12035: “She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”
line 12036: 
line 12037: “She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
line 12038: civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
line 12039: well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
line 12040: Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
line 12041: nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”
line 12042: 
line 12043: Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
line 12044: acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
line 12045: 
line 12046: 
line 12047: 
line 12048: Chapter 57
line 12049: 
line 12050: 
line 12051: The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
line 12052: Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
line 12053: hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
line 12054: appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
line 12055: for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
line 12056: Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
line 12057: of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
line 12058: till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
line 12059: and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
line 12060: expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
line 12061: the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
line 12062: sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
line 12063: at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
line 12064: Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
line 12065: only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
line 12066: forward to as possible at some future time.
line 12067: 
line 12068: In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
line 12069: feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
line 12070: in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
line 12071: prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
line 12072: an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
line 12073: representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
line 12074: not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
line 12075: aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
line 12076: that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
line 12077: was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
line 12078: whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
line 12079: address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
line 12080: probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
line 12081: and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
line 12082: 
line 12083: If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
line 12084: seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
line 12085: settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
line 12086: unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
line 12087: Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
line 12088: Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
line 12089: 
line 12090: “If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
line 12091: friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
line 12092: it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
line 12093: constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
line 12094: have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
line 12095: at all.”
line 12096: 
line 12097:                           * * * * *
line 12098: 
line 12099: The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
line 12100: been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
line 12101: kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
line 12102: Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
line 12103: 
line 12104: The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
line 12105: father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
line 12106: 
line 12107: “Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”
line 12108: 
line 12109: She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
line 12110: tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
line 12111: connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
line 12112: might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
line 12113: consequent explanations.
line 12114: 
line 12115: She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
line 12116: then said,
line 12117: 
line 12118: “I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
line 12119: exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
line 12120: contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
line 12121: of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”
line 12122: 
line 12123: The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
line 12124: conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
line 12125: and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
line 12126: himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
line 12127: herself; when her father continued:
line 12128: 
line 12129: “You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
line 12130: as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
line 12131: name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”
line 12132: 
line 12133: “From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”
line 12134: 
line 12135: “Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
line 12136: congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
line 12137: which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
line 12138: Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
line 12139: on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus
line 12140: offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
line 12141: this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
line 12142: of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
line 12143: Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
line 12144: her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
line 12145: be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
line 12146: this land.'
line 12147: 
line 12148: “Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? 'This young
line 12149: gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
line 12150: mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
line 12151: patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
line 12152: Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
line 12153: closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
line 12154: inclined to take immediate advantage of.'
line 12155: 
line 12156: “Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:
line 12157: 
line 12158: “'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
line 12159: that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
line 12160: a friendly eye.'
line 12161: 
line 12162: “_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
line 12163: surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
line 12164: the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
line 12165: more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
line 12166: woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
line 12167: life! It is admirable!”
line 12168: 
line 12169: Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
line 12170: one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
line 12171: little agreeable to her.
line 12172: 
line 12173: “Are you not diverted?”
line 12174: 
line 12175: “Oh! yes. Pray read on.”
line 12176: 
line 12177: “'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
line 12178: night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
line 12179: felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
line 12180: family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
line 12181: consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
line 12182: to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
line 12183: her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
line 12184: hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.
line 12185: Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
line 12186: business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
line 12187: living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
line 12188: known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
line 12189: from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
line 12190: couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
line 12191: encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
line 12192: very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
line 12193: as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
line 12194: names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian
line 12195: forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
line 12196: situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
line 12197: look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
line 12198: I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
line 12199: live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
line 12200: turn?”
line 12201: 
line 12202: “Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so
line 12203: strange!”
line 12204: 
line 12205: “Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
line 12206: it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
line 12207: pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
line 12208: writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any
line 12209: consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
line 12210: him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
line 12211: hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
line 12212: about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”
line 12213: 
line 12214: To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
line 12215: been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
line 12216: his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
line 12217: feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
line 12218: would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
line 12219: what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
line 12220: wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
line 12221: his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
line 12222: 
line 12223: 
line 12224: 
line 12225: Chapter 58
line 12226: 
line 12227: 
line 12228: Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
line 12229: Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
line 12230: with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
line 12231: visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
line 12232: to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
line 12233: in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
line 12234: their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
line 12235: habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
line 12236: set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
line 12237: to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
line 12238: were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
line 12239: was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
line 12240: desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
line 12241: 
line 12242: They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
line 12243: Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
line 12244: when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
line 12245: moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
line 12246: high, she immediately said:
line 12247: 
line 12248: “Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
line 12249: relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
line 12250: can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
line 12251: poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
line 12252: acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
line 12253: of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”
line 12254: 
line 12255: “I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
line 12256: and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
line 12257: mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
line 12258: was so little to be trusted.”
line 12259: 
line 12260: “You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
line 12261: me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
line 12262: not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
line 12263: in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
line 12264: you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
line 12265: sake of discovering them.”
line 12266: 
line 12267: “If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
line 12268: That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
line 12269: inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
line 12270: _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
line 12271: only of _you_.”
line 12272: 
line 12273: Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
line 12274: her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
line 12275: feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
line 12276: affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
line 12277: me on this subject for ever.”
line 12278: 
line 12279: Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
line 12280: his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
line 12281: very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
line 12282: so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
line 12283: her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
line 12284: happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
line 12285: felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
line 12286: warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
line 12287: been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
line 12288: expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
line 12289: but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
line 12290: feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
line 12291: affection every moment more valuable.
line 12292: 
line 12293: They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
line 12294: be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
line 12295: soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
line 12296: to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
line 12297: London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
line 12298: substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
line 12299: every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
line 12300: peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
line 12301: such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
line 12302: from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
line 12303: ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
line 12304: 
line 12305: “It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
line 12306: to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
line 12307: had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
line 12308: acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”
line 12309: 
line 12310: Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough
line 12311: of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
line 12312: abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
line 12313: your relations.”
line 12314: 
line 12315: “What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
line 12316: accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
line 12317: behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
line 12318: unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
line 12319: 
line 12320: “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
line 12321: evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
line 12322: will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
line 12323: in civility.”
line 12324: 
line 12325: “I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
line 12326: then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
line 12327: it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
line 12328: reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
line 12329: more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can
line 12330: scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
line 12331: I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
line 12332: 
line 12333: “I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
line 12334: impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
line 12335: a way.”
line 12336: 
line 12337: “I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
line 12338: feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
line 12339: forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
line 12340: way that would induce you to accept me.”
line 12341: 
line 12342: “Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
line 12343: all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
line 12344: 
line 12345: Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you
line 12346: think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
line 12347: contents?”
line 12348: 
line 12349: She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
line 12350: former prejudices had been removed.
line 12351: 
line 12352: “I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
line 12353: necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
line 12354: especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
line 12355: power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
line 12356: justly make you hate me.”
line 12357: 
line 12358: “The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
line 12359: preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
line 12360: opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
line 12361: changed as that implies.”
line 12362: 
line 12363: “When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly
line 12364: calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
line 12365: dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
line 12366: 
line 12367: “The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
line 12368: adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
line 12369: of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
line 12370: so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
line 12371: circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
line 12372: of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
line 12373: pleasure.”
line 12374: 
line 12375: “I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
line 12376: retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
line 12377: arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
line 12378: innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
line 12379: which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
line 12380: being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
line 12381: was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
line 12382: was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
line 12383: Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
line 12384: by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
line 12385: that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
line 12386: me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
line 12387: circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
line 12388: to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
line 12389: was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
line 12390: but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
line 12391: taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
line 12392: I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
line 12393: You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
line 12394: worthy of being pleased.”
line 12395: 
line 12396: “Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”
line 12397: 
line 12398: “Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
line 12399: wishing, expecting my addresses.”
line 12400: 
line 12401: “My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
line 12402: you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
line 12403: wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?”
line 12404: 
line 12405: “Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
line 12406: a proper direction.”
line 12407: 
line 12408: “I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
line 12409: Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
line 12410: 
line 12411: “No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”
line 12412: 
line 12413: “Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
line 12414: My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
line 12415: confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”
line 12416: 
line 12417: “My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in
line 12418: my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
line 12419: obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
line 12420: see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
line 12421: introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
line 12422: hour after I had seen you.”
line 12423: 
line 12424: He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
line 12425: disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
line 12426: the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
line 12427: following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
line 12428: before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
line 12429: there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
line 12430: comprehend.
line 12431: 
line 12432: She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
line 12433: each, to be dwelt on farther.
line 12434: 
line 12435: After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
line 12436: anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
line 12437: it was time to be at home.
line 12438: 
line 12439: “What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which
line 12440: introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
line 12441: their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
line 12442: it.
line 12443: 
line 12444: “I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.
line 12445: 
line 12446: “Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”
line 12447: 
line 12448: “That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
line 12449: though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
line 12450: the case.
line 12451: 
line 12452: “On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
line 12453: confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
line 12454: told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
line 12455: affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
line 12456: the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
line 12457: mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
line 12458: to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
line 12459: unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”
line 12460: 
line 12461: Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
line 12462: friend.
line 12463: 
line 12464: “Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
line 12465: that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
line 12466: 
line 12467: “From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
line 12468: which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”
line 12469: 
line 12470: “And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
line 12471: him.”
line 12472: 
line 12473: “It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
line 12474: prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
line 12475: his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
line 12476: one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
line 12477: allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
line 12478: last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
line 12479: angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
line 12480: in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
line 12481: now.”
line 12482: 
line 12483: Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
line 12484: friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
line 12485: herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
line 12486: and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
line 12487: of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
line 12488: continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
line 12489: parted.
line 12490: 
line 12491: 
line 12492: 
line 12493: Chapter 59
line 12494: 
line 12495: 
line 12496: “My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
line 12497: which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
line 12498: and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
line 12499: say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
line 12500: knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
line 12501: else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
line 12502: 
line 12503: The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
line 12504: acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
line 12505: Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
line 12506: and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
line 12507: than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
line 12508: there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
line 12509: in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
line 12510: one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
line 12511: dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
line 12512: 
line 12513: At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
line 12514: from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
line 12515: 
line 12516: “You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
line 12517: you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”
line 12518: 
line 12519: “This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
line 12520: I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
line 12521: in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
line 12522: engaged.”
line 12523: 
line 12524: Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
line 12525: you dislike him.”
line 12526: 
line 12527: “You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
line 12528: did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
line 12529: these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
line 12530: remember it myself.”
line 12531: 
line 12532: Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
line 12533: seriously assured her of its truth.
line 12534: 
line 12535: “Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried
line 12536: Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
line 12537: certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
line 12538: happy with him?”
line 12539: 
line 12540: “There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
line 12541: we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
line 12542: Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”
line 12543: 
line 12544: “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
line 12545: delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
line 12546: really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
line 12547: marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
line 12548: to do?”
line 12549: 
line 12550: “Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
line 12551: tell you all.”
line 12552: 
line 12553: “What do you mean?”
line 12554: 
line 12555: “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
line 12556: afraid you will be angry.”
line 12557: 
line 12558: “My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
line 12559: me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
line 12560: how long you have loved him?”
line 12561: 
line 12562: “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
line 12563: But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
line 12564: at Pemberley.”
line 12565: 
line 12566: Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
line 12567: desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
line 12568: of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
line 12569: further to wish.
line 12570: 
line 12571: “Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.
line 12572: I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
line 12573: I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
line 12574: husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
line 12575: Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
line 12576: tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
line 12577: of it to another, not to you.”
line 12578: 
line 12579: Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
line 12580: to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
line 12581: her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
line 12582: conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,
line 12583: and half the night spent in conversation.
line 12584: 
line 12585:                           * * * * *
line 12586: 
line 12587: “Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
line 12588: morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
line 12589: our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
line 12590: coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
line 12591: other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
line 12592: Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
line 12593: way.”
line 12594: 
line 12595: Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
line 12596: was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
line 12597: epithet.
line 12598: 
line 12599: As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
line 12600: shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
line 12601: and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
line 12602: hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
line 12603: 
line 12604: “I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk
line 12605: to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
line 12606: never seen the view.”
line 12607: 
line 12608: “It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
line 12609: sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that
line 12610: she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
line 12611: the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
line 12612: up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:
line 12613: 
line 12614: “I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
line 12615: disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
line 12616: all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
line 12617: to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
line 12618: inconvenience.”
line 12619: 
line 12620: During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
line 12621: asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
line 12622: application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother
line 12623: would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
line 12624: would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
line 12625: were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
line 12626: was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
line 12627: to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
line 12628: the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
line 12629: disapprobation.
line 12630: 
line 12631:                           * * * * *
line 12632: 
line 12633: In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
line 12634: Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
line 12635: extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
line 12636: be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
line 12637: his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
line 12638: filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
line 12639: reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
line 12640: looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
line 12641: he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
line 12642: pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he
line 12643: wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.
line 12644: 
line 12645: Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
line 12646: “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
line 12647: accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
line 12648: 
line 12649: How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
line 12650: reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
line 12651: explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
line 12652: but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
line 12653: of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
line 12654: 
line 12655: “Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
line 12656: sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
line 12657: But will they make you happy?”
line 12658: 
line 12659: “Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
line 12660: indifference?”
line 12661: 
line 12662: “None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
line 12663: this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
line 12664: 
line 12665: “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.
line 12666: Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
line 12667: know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
line 12668: such terms.”
line 12669: 
line 12670: “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind
line 12671: of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
line 12672: condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
line 12673: having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
line 12674: your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
line 12675: respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
line 12676: up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
line 12677: greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
line 12678: discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
line 12679: _you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
line 12680: about.”
line 12681: 
line 12682: Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
line 12683: at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
line 12684: of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
line 12685: him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
line 12686: was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'
line 12687: suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
line 12688: conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
line 12689: 
line 12690: “Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
line 12691: say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
line 12692: you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
line 12693: 
line 12694: To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
line 12695: had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
line 12696: 
line 12697: “This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
line 12698: made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
line 12699: his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
line 12700: and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
line 12701: paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
line 12702: way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
line 12703: his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
line 12704: 
line 12705: He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
line 12706: Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
line 12707: at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
line 12708: for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”
line 12709: 
line 12710: Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
line 12711: half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
line 12712: the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
line 12713: gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
line 12714: anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
line 12715: would come in time.
line 12716: 
line 12717: When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
line 12718: and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
line 12719: for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
line 12720: utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
line 12721: comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
line 12722: what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
line 12723: lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
line 12724: her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
line 12725: 
line 12726: “Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
line 12727: have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
line 12728: and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
line 12729: you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
line 12730: pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
line 12731: dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
line 12732: hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
line 12733: that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
line 12734: Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”
line 12735: 
line 12736: This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
line 12737: Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
line 12738: soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
line 12739: her mother followed her.
line 12740: 
line 12741: “My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten
line 12742: thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
line 12743: special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
line 12744: my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
line 12745: that I may have it to-morrow.”
line 12746: 
line 12747: This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
line 12748: himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
line 12749: possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
line 12750: consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
line 12751: passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
line 12752: in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
line 12753: him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
line 12754: deference for his opinion.
line 12755: 
line 12756: Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
line 12757: acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
line 12758: every hour in his esteem.
line 12759: 
line 12760: “I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
line 12761: is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
line 12762: as Jane's.”
line 12763: 
line 12764: 
line 12765: 
line 12766: Chapter 60
line 12767: 
line 12768: 
line 12769: Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
line 12770: Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
line 12771: you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
line 12772: you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
line 12773: place?”
line 12774: 
line 12775: “I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
line 12776: laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
line 12777: knew that I _had_ begun.”
line 12778: 
line 12779: “My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
line 12780: to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
line 12781: to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
line 12782: did you admire me for my impertinence?”
line 12783: 
line 12784: “For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”
line 12785: 
line 12786: “You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
line 12787: The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
line 12788: attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
line 12789: and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
line 12790: interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
line 12791: amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
line 12792: took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
line 12793: in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
line 12794: courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
line 12795: it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
line 12796: reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
line 12797: of _that_ when they fall in love.”
line 12798: 
line 12799: “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
line 12800: ill at Netherfield?”
line 12801: 
line 12802: “Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
line 12803: by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
line 12804: to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
line 12805: to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
line 12806: be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
line 12807: to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
line 12808: called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
line 12809: you look as if you did not care about me?”
line 12810: 
line 12811: “Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”
line 12812: 
line 12813: “But I was embarrassed.”
line 12814: 
line 12815: “And so was I.”
line 12816: 
line 12817: “You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”
line 12818: 
line 12819: “A man who had felt less, might.”
line 12820: 
line 12821: “How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
line 12822: I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
line 12823: _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
line 12824: you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
line 12825: thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
line 12826: _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
line 12827: springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
line 12828: subject. This will never do.”
line 12829: 
line 12830: “You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
line 12831: Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
line 12832: removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
line 12833: your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
line 12834: to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me
line 12835: hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”
line 12836: 
line 12837: “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
line 12838: for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
line 12839: Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
line 12840: or had you intended any more serious consequence?”
line 12841: 
line 12842: “My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
line 12843: might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
line 12844: myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
line 12845: and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”
line 12846: 
line 12847: “Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
line 12848: befall her?”
line 12849: 
line 12850: “I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
line 12851: ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
line 12852: done directly.”
line 12853: 
line 12854: “And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
line 12855: admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
line 12856: I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
line 12857: 
line 12858: From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
line 12859: had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
line 12860: long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
line 12861: be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
line 12862: aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
line 12863: follows:
line 12864: 
line 12865: “I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
line 12866: for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
line 12867: truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
line 12868: But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
line 12869: fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
line 12870: subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
line 12871: cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
line 12872: great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
line 12873: for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
line 12874: idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
line 12875: am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
line 12876: before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
line 12877: only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
line 12878: he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
line 12879: Yours, etc.”
line 12880: 
line 12881: Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
line 12882: different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
line 12883: to his last.
line 12884: 
line 12885: “DEAR SIR,
line 12886: 
line 12887: “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
line 12888: be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
line 12889: But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.
line 12890: 
line 12891: “Yours sincerely, etc.”
line 12892: 
line 12893: Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
line 12894: marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
line 12895: to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
line 12896: former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
line 12897: affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
line 12898: her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
line 12899: 
line 12900: The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
line 12901: was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
line 12902: insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
line 12903: being loved by her sister.
line 12904: 
line 12905: Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
line 12906: to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
line 12907: Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
line 12908: sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
line 12909: so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
line 12910: Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
line 12911: the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
line 12912: was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
line 12913: meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
line 12914: saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
line 12915: her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
line 12916: listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
line 12917: the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
line 12918: meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did
line 12919: shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
line 12920: 
line 12921: Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
line 12922: forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
line 12923: too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
line 12924: humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
line 12925: Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
line 12926: likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
line 12927: him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
line 12928: him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
line 12929: without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
line 12930: from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
line 12931: added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
line 12932: the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
line 12933: to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
line 12934: Pemberley.
line 12935: 
line 12936: 
line 12937: 
line 12938: Chapter 61
line 12939: 
line 12940: 
line 12941: Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
line 12942: rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
line 12943: she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
line 12944: be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
line 12945: accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
line 12946: of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
line 12947: amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
line 12948: was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
line 12949: in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
line 12950: invariably silly.
line 12951: 
line 12952: Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
line 12953: drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
line 12954: going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
line 12955: 
line 12956: Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
line 12957: a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
line 12958: _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
line 12959: sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
line 12960: to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
line 12961: of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
line 12962: 
line 12963: Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
line 12964: her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
line 12965: known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
line 12966: temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,
line 12967: she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
line 12968: ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's
line 12969: society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
line 12970: frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
line 12971: balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
line 12972: 
line 12973: Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
line 12974: drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
line 12975: unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
line 12976: she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
line 12977: longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
line 12978: it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
line 12979: much reluctance.
line 12980: 
line 12981: As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
line 12982: the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
line 12983: Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
line 12984: and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
line 12985: thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
line 12986: to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
line 12987: from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
line 12988: if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
line 12989: effect:
line 12990: 
line 12991: “MY DEAR LIZZY,
line 12992: 
line 12993: “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
line 12994: Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
line 12995: rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
line 12996: I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
line 12997: think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
line 12998: Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
line 12999: do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
line 13000: 
line 13001: “Yours, etc.”
line 13002: 
line 13003: As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
line 13004: her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
line 13005: Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
line 13006: of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
line 13007: frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
line 13008: income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
line 13009: their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
line 13010: their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
line 13011: herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
line 13012: towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
line 13013: restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
line 13014: extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
line 13015: situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
line 13016: her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
line 13017: in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
line 13018: reputation which her marriage had given her.
line 13019: 
line 13020: Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
line 13021: Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
line 13022: occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
line 13023: in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
line 13024: staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
line 13025: proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.
line 13026: 
line 13027: Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
line 13028: thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
line 13029: dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
line 13030: attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
line 13031: to Elizabeth.
line 13032: 
line 13033: Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
line 13034: was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
line 13035: other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
line 13036: in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
line 13037: an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
line 13038: talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
line 13039: which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
line 13040: pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
line 13041: in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that
line 13042: a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
line 13043: always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
line 13044: 
line 13045: Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
line 13046: and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
line 13047: her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
line 13048: language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
line 13049: all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
line 13050: he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
line 13051: and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
line 13052: resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
line 13053: to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
line 13054: on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
line 13055: received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
line 13056: visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
line 13057: 
line 13058: With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
line 13059: Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
line 13060: sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
line 13061: her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
